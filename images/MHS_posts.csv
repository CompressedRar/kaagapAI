ggs39f,mentalhealth,1589073745.0,"On a rainy March day, 4 years ago, my parents were out of town and I had a full-fledged suicide plan in place. I turned my phone off, I had filled my dog‚Äôs food and water bowls, I had my note printed out, and I sat solemnly in the silence of my home, enjoying what I believed was my final meal- a bowl of Kraft Mac n Cheese. 

You see, I was a freshman in college, and had gotten raped by a man I had recently met. When I attempted to speak out against what happened to me, I was immediately labeled a whore. Anything I said was discredited by him and his friends, since I had freely chosen to go and see him at night. Besides, he was a Marine. His reputation was impeccable. People with so much to lose don‚Äôt do things like that, right?

After multiple attempts to tell my foreign parents that I was struggling mentally, and with all of those attempts being minimized to ‚Äúdepression is for the weak‚Äù, I had had enough.

Halfway through my Mac n Cheese, I heard a knock at my front door. Strange, since it was a Friday night and I was not expecting company. I decided to answer the door anyways. 

It was a guy I had went to high school with. I did not consider him a friend, but he knew where I lived because we were partners for a high school group project years prior. He kept in touch after high school because during the time we spent working on our group project, he had discovered my closeted obsession for Pok√©mon. He would occasionally send me interesting updates about the game. Despite this, I overlooked him and admittedly never really thought much about his presence in my life. 

I was, obviously, very confused why he had showed up to my house, unannounced. He reached into his pocket and handed me a pack of unopened Pok√©mon cards. He said that he had been at the store, and remembered that we had briefly discussed a particular card set a few weeks prior, so he decided to buy it for me. He said that he had texted, asking if he could come drop it off, but that his message was not delivering. Since my house was on the route back to his, he decided to stop by to drop it off. It was a nice gesture, but in that moment, I could not have cared less. As I thanked him and went to close the door, he asked if I wanted to go for a drive. I said no thanks, and that I had other things planned for the night. He was never a pushy guy, but he insisted that I joined him. I sighed, and grabbed my jacket. 

He aimlessly drove me around. We sat in absolute silence for hours, besides him occasionally asking if the temperature in his car was okay and if it was okay if he stopped for gas. I was confused on what we were doing. A part of me was afraid that he was working up the nerve to do what the Marine had done to me months prior. Another piece of me was terrified at the fact that I was too drained, my spirit so broken, to even care if he did. 

But he didn‚Äôt.

He drove. He drove until his tank was nearing empty. He went and filled his tank. And then, he kept driving. I don‚Äôt know why I didn‚Äôt question it, but I guess I was just so relieved that my plans for the night had changed. In that moment, I knew that I, in fact, did not want to kill myself. When my mind came to that realization, I began sobbing hysterically. Would you believe me if I said that he simply kept on driving? He kept driving until I began to doze off. When he noticed, he took me home. As I was exiting his car, he said to me, ‚ÄúAnything else planned for tonight?‚Äù I shook my head no. He nodded, and thought for a moment, before saying, ‚ÄúText me tomorrow to let me know how you liked the cards.‚Äù I nodded and went inside. I took the suicide note I had sitting on the coffee table, and put it into my dad‚Äôs shredder in his home office. I took the Pok√©mon cards out of my pocket, and placed them in the place the note had been. I told myself that I would wait to open them the next morning. Because for the first time, in a very long time, there was a ‚Äúnext morning‚Äù to look forward to. 


From that day on, Kraft Mac n Cheese became a food I would eat whenever I was feeling particularly low. Rather than it being a last meal of sorts, it now serves as a source of comfort- a reminder that there are always mini sources of joy in this world, whether that be a bowl of Mac n Cheese, or a pack of Pok√©mon cards.",https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/ggs39f/to_the_man_who_saved_my_life_and_never_knew/,To the man who saved my life and never knew,,1930,113,0.99

k7mxc8,mentalhealth,1607228909.0,"My cousin recently killed herself. We were close when we were growing up. Her parents were extremely strict and had very high expectations of her, expectations she obviously felt she couldn't meet. 

I'm pissed off because in her memorial, not once did they mention it was a suicide. The closest thing I could find to an acknowledgement of that fact was in an obituary posted elsewhere online, where they said she ""succumbed to the pressures of COVID-19"" which is the most bullshit way to sugar-coat a suicide they could've come up with. As someone who has been very very close to taking my own life, having been hospitalized for that very reason just last year, it bothered me to my core that they pretended like it didn't happen. Just sang songs about god, beating around the bush and making it clear that she would be going to ""heaven"" and not ""hell"" even though everyone knows she did the big bad and committed ""sin"". No recognition at all for the pain she had obviously been dealing with silently for her entire life.

I posted on her memorial site, just a quick blurb of some memories I had with her, a nice photo of us when we were young,  and I quick sentence at the end basically saying ""Some of us face our struggles silently, and you never know who could be fighting an invisible battle, so always be there to lend a shoulder to someone, whether they ask for it or not."" And I linked NAMI and the suicide hotline. 

They fucking deleted my post and asked me to take all references to suicide or struggles out. They reached out to my parents too to try and reign me in. 

I'm honestly appalled. They seem embarrassed and ashamed of her, and they want to hide what she did because it makes them look bad in the ""eyes of God"". Fuck man. Wouldn't even let a supportive message and a link to NAMI slip in there. Had to be clean and without any reference to mental health whatsoever.

But I knew the sand wasn‚Äôt real. I was capable of being a function human, so I decided to be one. I got out of bed, showered and brushed my teeth, I put on clothes and left the house briefly to shop. And then I binge ate crap food, drank vodka, watched 10 hours of tv whilst taking lots of pain meds for back trouble. 

I‚Äôm not really sure what I‚Äôm trying to say. I guess I want people to know that I tried. I fought back at my body and forced myself up, forced myself to do the bare minimum of existing and damnit - I was so proud. I want the satisfaction of ‚Äòdoing the healthy thing‚Äô even though it was hard, and then I want the reward to be a sudden ability to live easily. 

But it didn‚Äôt come. I gave in to the dull ache of sadness and consumed sugar, salt and digital crap until I felt sick. I‚Äôm back in bed now thinking about every mistake I made today and how I wish I was stronger. 

I know that a path back to a healthy mental space/ lifestyle is going to be a long, hard road after neglecting it for so long. And I know I have to do it, and do it now before it deteriorates further. I just wish it wasn‚Äôt so intensely challenging. I wish that I didn‚Äôt have to eat healthily, exercise, keep a tidy house, be social JUST TO STAY AFLOAT.

Missing a run means missing on the happy endorphins I rely on to keep me going through the day.

3 years ago, my family home was foreclosed on. 2 years ago my mom had a stroke and was paralyzed and left unable to speak. 3 months ago she passed away after a long battle. I haven‚Äôt been able to speak to my best friend for 2 years and now I‚Äôll never be able to. 

Within that time, I had two suicide attempts. I was on pills. I was drinking alone everyday. I was hospitalized. I was uninsured. I was homeless. I thought I was beyond repair. 

For two years now since then, I‚Äôve been in therapy. Every week for two years. 

Now, I‚Äôm engaged. An awesome step son. I have a good job. A nice place to live. I‚Äôm excited for the future. 

Therapy saved me. But not my therapist. 

My therapist is amazing. He‚Äôs smart. Insightful. Knows when to listen. But when I started therapy, I thought my therapist would just tell me what to do. I‚Äôd do it. And I‚Äôd be fixed. 

That‚Äôs not how it worked for me. 

A lot of my friends who aren‚Äôt in therapy have been afraid to, or too stubborn to go seek help. 

They think they know better than a professional. BUT HERES THE RUB: My therapist didn‚Äôt know how to fix me. 

I did. 

(For me personally) therapy has been about bringing out repressed thoughts and feelings. Things I couldn‚Äôt talk to my friends about. Couldn‚Äôt talk about with my family.

Therapy also made me take accountability. For all my mistakes, the people I‚Äôve wronged.

I can now accept my past and look to the future. A future I wanted to take away from myself. 

I hope if even one person reads this and feels inclined to help themselves. Because you can.

junrt7,mentalhealth,1605454870.0,"Although I myself still struggle after being raped nearly 2 and a half years ago (and the rape will impact me my whole life) I want to let you know that time really heals wounds.

After, I got raped it was the worst time in my life. There are no words to describe how horrible it was. From a person who was very confident, lived in multiple countries, travelled the world I was afraid to go to my local grocery shop. I nearly had a panic attack when I was alone with a man in a shopping aisle. I had to postpone all my exams, my academic and social life suffered immensely. I had PTSD, anxiety, depression etc. I had very dark thoughts. I considered taking a year out of university because just getting out of bed was a struggle for me. I could write a book about all the negative effects of rape.

But now I honestly feel so much better. Of course, I still suffer the effects. But compared to the past I have made great progress. I am planning to continue my therapy though as I feel like my healing process is not over.

But I want to let you know that things will get better. I have graduated from top 30 university in the world with a prestigious degree, last year I was a committee member of multiple societies at my university. I am looking forward to life.

One thing I would tell you is that don‚Äôt put a timeline or deadline for your recovery. And don't compare yourself to others. I used to wonder will I ever get better. Why I am not getting better already? Why is it taking so long? Don‚Äôt compare your recovery to someone else. Although I will recover the whole of my life, what I mean is that If you are not getting better/progressing in a certain period of time is okay.

Everyone is different and take as much time you need to heal.

For me, it was also hard to see all my friends enjoying life and this tragedy happening to me. But now I am slowly accepting that life didn‚Äôt turn out exactly the way I wanted. And bad things happened to good people.

I am posting this because I felt much better myself reading stories of rape victims that persevered and ‚Äòovercame‚Äô their trauma.

gyzwgr,mentalhealth,1591624996.0,"13 Reasons Why has always been controversial from the start. I understand where people come from when they say the first season glorified suicide. Personally, I believe the first season had good intentions, and truly was trying to raise awareness for suicide.

Of course, they completely sabotaged Hannah Baker‚Äôs character in S2, which had a detrimental effect on the message.

But Season 4 - oh, it makes my blood boil. Clay‚Äôs undiagnosed, undefined ‚Äúmental illness‚Äù - at best described by the show as ‚Äútrauma‚Äù - is used as an excuse for outrageously bad behavior. By bad behavior, I mean locking his friends in a cabin in the woods and clanging an axe against the door. I mean vandalizing his school and burning his principal‚Äôs car. I mean waving a gun around in front of the entire student body.

And worst of all, when he finds out his adoptive brother is dying, his immediate response is to run to the police station and yell, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got a gun!‚Äù Why? Because he needed people ‚Äúto see how broken he was.‚Äù

This one really hit me close to home. When I was 6, my infant sister had to spend all 4.5 months of her life on a ventilator in the hospital. When she died - near Christmas time - I did not go terrorize people so that they could see ‚Äúhow broken I was.‚Äù

Yet [few people](https://youtu.be/ynewf90xWZc) see it that way. When I say this, 13 RW fans tell me ‚ÄúWell, you were 6. Your emotions were not as deep as our beloved FICTIONAL character Clay.‚Äù

I rang in my 24th today in a room with a baby suspected for COVID-19 who was very sick. I was holding the baby while the doctor was doing a lumbar puncture. Wearing the same mask I've been wearing all day and full gown, face shields, gloves.

I could feel my phone vibrating with messages from friends/family. I'm not even an emotional person but I just started crying silently. Everyone was so concentrated that no one noticed. I went to the back after and spent 20 mins having a good cry while listening to the stable song from BOTW (LOL).

I wasn't sad about working on my birthday, having to wear sweaty PPE all day or even having to deal with a sick baby (I deal with them all the time). I think I was just so overwhelmed the last few weeks and this was the first time I let my emotions out.

He woke me up right before my alarm so there was time for me to pet him. Then would hop off and meow until I got out of bed. Then led me to the bathroom, and would wait on top of the toilet until I was done showering. If I took longer than ten minutes he‚Äôd start meowing. Then he‚Äôd sit on top of my counter and watch me brush my teeth, and try to grab the floss as I was using it. Then he would hop down and strut in front of me, looking behind to make sure I was following, and lead me to my bag. Once I picked up my bag, he‚Äôd lead me downstairs to the kitchen. He would then sit on one of the chairs and watch me cook and eat breakfast, and when I was getting all ready to leave, he would wait for me to walk over and pet him goodbye for the day.

When I got home, he‚Äôd be waiting for me. He‚Äôd lead me back upstairs and stand in the spot my bag‚Äôs supposed to go. Then we‚Äôd play fetch with toy balls and I‚Äôd give him lots of pets until we tired out. Then I would get on the computer for work and games, and he‚Äôd hop into his cat bed nearby and fall asleep. When it was time for bed, he sometimes even got up to lead me to the bathroom and make sure I was brushing my teeth, then go back to bed.

Since the pandemic started, I‚Äôve had nowhere to go. Nothing to do. And even several months later, I can tell he misses the routine. He still tries to wake me up on time. He‚Äôs been trying different tactics. The most effective one so far seems to be bringing a toy and doing cuddle rolls just out of reach of the bed so I have to get up to pet him. He still meows if I‚Äôm in the shower for more than ten minutes. When I do finally go downstairs, he rushes ahead of me halfway down and leads me the rest of the way.

I wrote my suicide note this morning and my plan was to take my pistol and end it all tonight when I got home from work. I had everything planned and I was set. Then this evening I was at work delivering pizzas. I went to this one house and I wasn‚Äôt sure if I was at the right address or not but there was a man in the driveway and I asked him if I was at the right address. He said he wasn‚Äôt sure because it was his bosses house, not his, and he was only there to pick up his car. Then we started talking and he mentioned how I was smiling. He spoke about how he was 63 years old, he was a military veteran, and how with people my age he doesn‚Äôt see people smile like I did. It was a fake smile I put on so when I greet customers it‚Äôs a good experience. But he picked up on my smile, we chatted and he was making me laugh, he ended up giving me a big hug and was telling me how I should appreciate my friends, my family, and life. This guy had no clue I was depressed and suicidal and was planning on taking my life 3 hours later, yet he still told me all of this. He ended up giving me some cheese he had (I didn‚Äôt eat it) but the reason why he gave it to me is because  the packaging had a huge smile on it and he told me to have it and to keep on smiling and spreading positivity. 

This guy was only at the house to pick up his car, he was only there for 5 minutes, yet in that 5 minutes is when I showed up.

Also, if someones symptoms don't seem as severe as your own, that doesn't mean they don't have a problem and therefore aren't entitled to get help. Kids shouldn't need to come out about being depressed by attempting suicide because they have no other way to prove it's a real problem that they deal with. And they definitely shouldn't have to go as far as to commit suicide to show they've struggled.

&#x200B;

I want people to get help without being told their OCD is for attention, and that their depression is just an excuse to be lazy, their anxiety is just an excuse to avoid doing things, or their ADHD is just an excuse to misbehave. If people are so worried over others faking this stuff for pity, then maybe don't give them pity and that's the problem solved then? Instead of giving them the things you think they're faking problems to get, try to push them to see professional help and leave it at that instead of going out of your way to make it worse for them.

&#x200B;

Nobody should be allowed to do terrible things and get away with it by blaming their disorder, I get that. If someone you know is doing that, treat it like the law does: don't punish or hate them, but maybe send them to a psych ward to get help if they truthfully are harming others because they can't control themselves.

If anyone out there is afraid to come out about a struggle of theirs because they're afraid of being called an attention seeker, don't hold back because of people like this.

ie5bs7,mentalhealth,1598043950.0,"I have had an insane life full of dark trauma, abuse, alcoholism, suicide, despair, extreme loss, stalking, harassment, and destitution. For years I wanted to die and I begged my mother for permission to die to end my suffering. I literally got my brain zapped 14 times to fight it (ECT is actually very safe and effective for severe treatment resistant depression). But all those labels don't matter.

So let me tell you a few things: 

1. Your suffering is as equally valid as mine. 
2. Everything is relative. You can have an amazing life and still be suffering.
3. Your suffering does not need justification. You feel what you feel. Screw invalidating statements like ""It's just hormones"".
4. We all have our own journey don't compare your life/struggles to those of others.
5. You deserve growth as a human being even if you don't feel like you do. Our illnesses cloud our perspective of the past, present, and future.
6. Don't believe everything you think.
7. There is no ""cure"". Suffering is part of human existence and by learning to accept it and sit with it we can overcome it.

dtmqje,mentalhealth,1573251025.0,"Today is my birthday and this sounds pretty sad, but I just want someone to wish me a happy birthday and maybe say something nice. I no longer have any friends or family left and just want some sort of human connection, even if it is just over Reddit, to make me feel just a bit less isolated and forgotten.

I have just endured so much lately and I don't have anyone to talk to or confide in, but I thought I could make it through today just fine. I was wrong. I feel stupid and pitiful while I'm typing this, but I just want to know someone is out there and understands.Getting to this point happened without me even realizing how solitary I had become until I was completely alone. I might as well lay it out, as just the act of typing it might be some sort of catharsis.

So how did I end up here? I started typing out damn near my whole life story, but that made this post so long that if I left it included there was an even smaller chance someone would read this. So highlights then? Abandoned by parents, raised by grandparents, abused by neighbor from ages 5 to 8, horrible abandonment issues, started getting into drugs, dropped out of high school, got a GED, some life happened, was totally Goth, some more life happened, made some music and art, now only Goth on the inside, started college, got married, wife left and grandparents arrested/institutionalized due to Alzheimer's/dementia in the same weekend, abruptly left college to move home to sort everything out, oh hey drugs, slowly watched my only family deteriorate before my eyes until they didn't even recognize me any longer, raging heroin addiction to try not to feel any of this, grandfather died, got in trouble with the law, lost everything I owned, homeless junkie interlude, lost almost 3 years of my life in jail/prison over less than $4,000 worth of bad checks, oops can't get a decent job due to criminal record, congestive heart failure, almost die, start getting my life back together, meet a nice girl, marry nice girl, grandmother dies, oh hey again drugs, finally got off the drugs, surprise wife departure, heart failure keeps getting worse, can barely walk, can't work anymore, no job, no insurance, no access to healthcare.

That about sums it up the backstory. I finally have gotten some healthcare and counseling. Sadly, I can no longer work. I'm trying to go through the disability process, but that takes a great deal of time. It is difficult without proper access to the doctors I need, but I'm getting there. I've also been clean for 4 years and I'm never going back to that dependence. Never before in my life did I ever feel like I was completely done with drugs, but this time it has really stuck. Haven't even had any cravings and now it never even crosses my mind. I'm finally in a good and stable place in my recovery.

Now I have other issues though. Poverty is very real. The threat of eviction looms nearly every month. Being able to afford the 12 different prescriptions I take is really hard and I find myself cutting pills in half because even $70 a month for medicine is a real challenge. I was able to get enrolled back in college and that is the plan of how to survive until I graduate and find work I'm physically able to handle. I'm working towards a career in counseling because I want to be able to use all of these nightmare experiences to help other people. I want to use what time I have left on this planet to help others and hopefully leave it better than I found it.

That is how you end up alone on your 40th birthday, typing on an ancient laptop that you pray survives a couple more months until you transfer schools and can get a replacement with financial aid funds. My family died. Drugs pushed everyone away for years except other drug addicts and an addict isn't anyone's friend. I am no longer able to work, so I don't have those human connections anymore. My wife had been my best friend, so when she surprised me by suddenly leaving the last person I had a connection with went with her. Now that my congestive heart failure has progressed just walking enough to shop for groceries, take out the trash, or getting the mail is a huge challenge, so just going out to walk around and meet people is near impossible. Having zero available disposable income also doesn't help. If I can hold on a couple more months and everything works out I'll be able to switch schools and have more aid options that will take care of my financial and healthcare needs. I'm just trying to hold on and it is so hard.

There is the abbreviated story if you somehow stopped on this post and actually read through everything. If you made it this far, thank you for listening. If you have the time to say happy birthday or say something nice I would really appreciate it. You really don't know how much it would mean to me. No one else is going to tell me today, so you might get to be the only person that wishes me a happy birthday. I don't get any presents or any cake. I don't get a birthday meal or get to do anything cool. I don't get to go anywhere or see anyone. There won't be any birthday cards in the mail or celebratory emails. That's okay though. If one person manages to take the time to read this and let me know there is someone, anyone out there then it'll be alright.

Edit: Update - Thanks so much to everyone. I barely have any words. Just thank you all so very much. You did bring a grown man to tears, but the best kind.

I looked at him with disdain. ""Why are you crying?"" I asked in annoyance. I didn't realize it then, but my visceral reaction to his emotional vulnerability reflected¬†something¬†that I had been taught earlier¬†in my childhood: boys aren't supposed to¬†cry. 

When I became a young adult, I had a lot of trouble expressing my emotions. I put on a smile for everyone I saw, and avoided talking about anything that would trigger an emotional reaction. When my emotions built up to the point where I couldn‚Äôt control them, I would explode. It took a long time to learn how to share my feelings - something that people still consider to be a sign of weakness in men.

I think I‚Äôm one of the millions of men out there who‚Äôve been told, at some point in their lives, to repress their emotions. I now understand how emotional repression can¬†lead¬†to a variety of complications in mental health. I wrote a song to challenge the idea that men shouldn‚Äôt show their feelings simply because they are men. Listen link below.

For all the guys out there listening to this song - be vulnerable. Feel your emotions. Share with others how you feel. I think that‚Äôs even more manly than being a tough guy.

It has been two weeks, I was basically out of money in a new city, have searched everywhere for a job but couldn't find any, so I decided to go to the social services center at the town hall to see if they could help me anyway. Shared with the staff my story and how I was going to be homeless that same day, but since it is a small city, the social worker contacted a friend of hers that owned a place that was looking for a woman to cook, clean and receive guests at a private tourist attraction.  

Although I'm male, she decided to give me a chance, and so it has been two weeks of hard work but everything is working out so far. I actually like the job a lot, and my employer seems to be quite happy with my performance and already increased my salary from past week. 

My anxiety and depression are way under control now. It seems that since my work requires more doing and less thinking it just keeps my mind better focused in the job and been glad for this opportunity that while I still get some intrusive thoughts once in a while, they are way less aggressive than they were in the past few months/years.

So that is it.

Let me fucking tell you something. I am so sick and tired of hearing people say that suicide is selfish. You want to know what's fucking selfish? Expecting someone else to live for you. Expecting someone to put their own personal pain to the side for your fucking happiness. Expecting your relationship or companionship to be that saving grace to pull anyone through a deep depression. THAT is the epitomy of selfish. It is no one's responsibility to do anything that makes other people happy or comfortable. You are not owed any of that. You don't get to tell someone who's suicidal that they're selfish for considering it and that they should think about others egos before their suffering. You don't get to call someone selfish after they commit suicide because they didn't think about everyone else's feelings when they obviously couldn't even handle their own. On top of the fact that it's disrespectful to speak ill of the dead. How selfish do you have to be to have the audacity to call someone selfish when you are the one who wants a dangerously depressed person to continue suffering just so you can continue to ignore all the symptoms but hand them a god damn gold start sticker for being alive like it fucking helps anything? And before you even bring religion into the conversation, news flash, Not everyone believes in your God so telling someone ""God doesn't make mistakes"", ""Suicide is a sin"", ""God only gives us what we can handle"", or some other idiotic bullshit, doesn't bring everyone comfort and sometimes it makes things worse. And that's not your opportunity to tell them all the ways they need to find God. Because again: Not. Everyone. Believes. In. Your. Fucking. God. End of. Telling a suicidal person that wanting to end their pain is selfish will only tell them that they cannot confide in you and it marks you as an unreliable support system. It will more than likely make them pull away from you and make them feel even more isolated. YOU'RE NOT HELPING! And don't use the excuses ""I've been through worse and I don't want to kill myself"" or ""Other people have it worse"" because you obviously don't understand what mental illness is. Being depressed about a situation is so much different than being clinically depressed. Situational depression lasts through a particular struggle. Clinical depression is being sad for almost no god damn reason. Don't compare the two because you're only making yourself look like more of an asshole.

Ten years ago I threw my legs out a 6th floor window at college, intending to hit the earth below me. I was in the thick of some really terrible times then. I was 19, heartbroken, homesick, lost, and very confused. I remember the sharp air that rushed in the room when I opened the window that very cold and snowy February night. It felt like little needles on my skin; a stark contrast to the hot, salty tears streaming down my face. I was in trouble for drinking on campus...again.  However, the drinking wasn‚Äôt just purely fun and games. I was using it to cope with a lot of uncertainty and hopelessness. My on again off again boyfriend told me he was dating someone else. He lived with my best guy friend at the time so a lot of ‚Äúsides‚Äù were taken in the whole mess. And somewhere along the way my roommate moved out. I was alone. 

I spent the remainder of the week at the hospital under psychiatric care. The days I spent there blur together now. I was in such a haze of numbness. 
My entire life was uprooted. I got kicked out of college and I had to start over somewhere new. The next several years were spent kicking my ass into gear to show myself and the friends who abandoned me that they didn‚Äôt get the best of me. I pushed and pushed myself. I started looking forward and not backward. I learned to love myself again. Slowly. Very slowly. 

I graduated from a new (and better) college with honors two years later. I took a chance and bought a one way ticket to NYC and began living the life I used to only be able to dream about.

10 years later, I am living proof that things get better. Depression and anxiety are challenges I still deal with occasionally, but now I know how to handle it. 

Right now I‚Äôm sitting in the house I just bought all by myself. I‚Äôm reminiscing about the years I spent living and working in Manhattan, where I had an incredible job and amazing friends. Most days, my life felt like a happy movie. I recently decided to re-locate, slow things down and enjoy the present. Now I‚Äôm in the process of renovating my house from the inside out. I volunteer with an organization that raises funds for underprivileged women and children. I carve out time for my hobbies, friends, and loved ones. I‚Äôve truly become a better person. I can now enjoy a glass or two of wine without overdoing it just to cope. I can take a deep breath, a small sip, and appreciate how far I‚Äôve come.

I still have a long way to go. I‚Äôm still a work in progress. I haven‚Äôt found love yet but I look forward to the day I do. In the meantime, you can catch me cultivating my new herb garden and reading a good book or two. 

If you‚Äôre going through what I went through 10 years ago, my best advice is to hang on, know it does get better (and no this isn‚Äôt something that people just say. It‚Äôs true). You‚Äôre not alone. You‚Äôre loved. And you‚Äôre stronger than you think.
Take a deep breath, be thankful that you are able to do so, and repeat until you truly believe better days are around the corner.

r8q060,mentalhealth,1638625610.0,"I did a random experiment on myself a few years ago. I did not read about this anywhere, I just thought of it and decided to try it.


I forced myself to think nice thoughts about every stranger I see. When I see someone on the street, I think of something nice about that person. Like ""their hair look so good"", ""what a nice smile"", ""those legs are great"" etc. In the beginning it was hard. Like, the first thought that popped up was something mean, but then I followed it up to find something good about the person.


If I don't find anything nice to think about their appearances (it happens), I don't force it, instead I make a nice assumption about them. I think ""she probably has a great sense of humour"", ""he is probably a great dad"", ""this person could be very creative"" etc. Just whatever pops up, and the great part is, it doesn't matter if it's true or not. I just form a nice assumption in my mind. 


In the beginning I had to consciously make the decision to think something nice. After a while it started automatically happen. It's been years, but now every time I go out I think mostly kind thoughts about people. This lead me to think more nice thoughts about myself. When I see myself in a mirror, I'm no longer trained to search for flaws, I automatically think nice things about myself aswell. I'm a much more confident person due to this.


If you want to try this, I recommend starting with strangers. When that becomes natural, apply it to everyone. Your classmates, your colleagues, your friends. Force yourself to focus on the positives. If you think something negative of someone, thats perfectly okay, but follow it up with something nice. Now I have an easier time giving people spontaneous and genuine compliments, because that's how my mind works. I'm a lot happier and calmer around people when I think kind thoughts about everyone. And this is not something that happened naturally, I had to train myself to do this, and it worked!

I want to add, that I've had some friends that were the opposite. The kind that thinks it's fun to roast everyone they see and say mean things about strangers or acquaintances. I talked to them about this, talked to them about how I'm changing my mindset and asked them to not behave like this around me. Some changed, some I am no longer friends with. Not a big loss, in hindsight. People that act like that was a negative influence in my life anyway.

I was told, by two friends of 10+ years, that my depression was ""too much,"" and that they ""couldn't handle it."" They told me that I needed to ""own up to my actions"" (being depressed, I guess???). Then, they just deleted me from everything and stopped talking to me. Some friends, eh?

Still makes me sick to this day. But perhaps, it's better to be rid of those people.

My names Jack, I'm 15 years old, bi (not come out to anyone), have dandruff, acne, pretty fucking ugly all things considered... And severe anxiety and depression.

I was living great until last June. At the time I had 2 best mates, who I'll refer to as M (funny, kind but not entirely good to talk about mental health and touchy feelings) and K (kindest person ever, used to be able to speak about anything to, but mentally isn't great). K had severe mental health issues and was not listening to anybodys advice about seeking help. Eventually I asked M if I should confront her about it, he agreed, I did it because my other friend who I'll refer to as J (narsasistic, arrogant, but has a soft side occasionally) had been telling me for months she was an attention seeker. I figured she'd take it alright but I was wrong. She trusted me more than anyone (her words) and it was the worst thing anyone had apparently told her.

It bothered me alot and I kept trying to make ammends because I felt TERRIBLE.

I was relatively stable in the grand scheme tho.

2 months pass and August aka summer holidays hits! Worst month and a half ever. J had somehow convinced M I was basically a backstabbing, lying piece of shit and essentially the worst person ever.

We argued back and forth for a while. We fell out hard to say the least.

It broke my heart losing both M and K (I guess J) in such a short time and the misery started to sink in.

HOPE WASN'T LOST. I had 2 friends left B (kind, nice to talk with, quiet) and Z (think J but a geek gamer and a textbook bully) I had a plan to get M K and J face to face (all previous stuff was done by text). Z was on holiday. So I tried asking B to get them together, he said to wait until school but I insisted as K didn't go to our school. I accepted tho. However (according to what I've been told) B lied I think and told Z I had manipulated him into trying to get them all together. Z bullied the shit out of me.

This is where I think my depression sunk in, I couldn't think properly, lashed out in anger out everyone, was bored of gaming, etc. Moral of the story, I wanted to put a bullet in my head!

September hit and school started (year 10). Depressed anxious and suicidal my studies went down and thus my grades.

Then my parents split, IT SUCKED. My father isn't exactly great, he can be abusiveish at times.

Everything started to get worse and I ran away several times, and dragged a knife across my arm alot.

I started to sit in the library for most of the day and still did until corona. Got sent work and it definitely helped with my anxiety as I was bullied and a laughing stock in year 9. Pretty badly. So being out of lessons was alright.

I started seeing the school councillor which helped to have someone to talk to. 

In December the school had no choice but to take me to arrow park hospital as I had massive scars across my chest from self harm. I stayed overnight and my parents ended up kinda talking things out.

I had to go to therapy to say the least. I was still on the edge of suicide.

Started the 8 week course this January and it was alright. Helped keep me positive. 
J and Z made me want to die more as they constantly reminded me of what I am, a monster. Told me I was worthless, should just do it and brought up my Instagram stories (I used to post on them suicidal stuff as a cry for help but was just accused of attention seeking). Worse too. 

Throughout the next 2 months I still stayed mostly the same. Suicidal, depressed, anxious, most importantly lonely. Me and M eventually worked things out because I actually put the effort in a lot over several months begging him and K to help me and how sorry I was. They didn't really want to be my friend. K and I are currently on OK terms I think, imma take it slow with her. M and I talk a lot now.

But... I still feel lonely, have to hide how I feel now. Don't really have anyone to talk about this stuff to. Anymore at least. I still hate my life. Want to die. Does make me wonder if I'm actually really liked by anyone.

But how would I describe myself? Gamer (mk11, overwatch, paladins and smash), want to do well but knows I can't, socially awkward on 1 to 1s, try to be funny, nice to people who I care for and are nice to me, would die for my closest friends. But I'm lonely ultimately, depressed, can't ride a bike, swim, fear of driving etc.

b258ki,mentalhealth,1552829913.0,"First and foremost you need some rest. I would say that 10/10 times when I have suicidal ideation it‚Äôs also when I am over tired or over worked.

Secondly there are people in your life that genuinely care enough to force you into help. I know it‚Äôs scary to reach out to them and admit that you are having a hard time alone but I whole heartedly recommend it. I would not be alive to type this if it weren‚Äôt for the wonderful people in my support network. One method my friend and I came up with is that I can kill myself, I just have to get his permission first. This gives me the benefit of having the ‚Äúoption‚Äù but also puts the social pressure on me to never do it. 

I know you might think no one gives a shit, but the same people who would be devastated if you died would probably prefer to help you out before it gets to that point. There is something socially validating about suicide in the brain of the suicidal. It feels easier than to admit you are having a hard time. You feel like people will take what you are going through seriously. But plain and simple you will not be around to enjoy that validation because you will be dead. And all the people who would have helped you will be asking what they could have done. Instead of leaving the people you love on this Earth with the trauma of dealing with your death, please reach out to them.

Lastly what you have gone through is not easy. You may feel exhausted, defeated or even angry at others. Self reflection might be productive but you are right to feel angry at how they treated you. What you do with that anger is your responsibility now and it seems like you are just letting it eat away at you. Maybe there is some way to can transfer that anger into productivity or artistic expression. Who knows?

You have real problems. They suck, you‚Äôre totally right to feel that way. You should feel no blame that shitty things happen to you. But these problems are still your responsibility. And there are people out there who can help. Again I would not be alive today if it wasn‚Äôt for the friend I mentioned above and a wonderful therapist who came in at the right time. You may not have luck the first few times; my first therapist sent me into a mental breakdown. But I promise you that you will find the right fit if you keep trying.

Focus on the problems that you can solve. I think about the serenity prayer they say in AA every day. ‚ÄúGrant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference‚Äù. There are many issues in your life you may not have control over, but there are some that you do. Focus on those. Try to define them as precisely as possible. Don‚Äôt say ‚Äúeverybody hates me‚Äù. Say ‚Äúeverybody hates me when I ______‚Äù. The first is a cry of defeat. The second gives you a concrete area of yourself that you can improve. I always tell my friend ‚Äúif you are going to hate yourself, at least be more specific‚Äù.

There is so much in life worth living for. A beautiful sunrise, your daughter‚Äôs graduation some day. Hell even if it‚Äôs just a new season of a tv show you love. The future is a mystery, and that‚Äôs a good thing. It means that everything is going to change. If things are good they are going to get worse. But that also means if things are bad they are going to get better. Take solace in that during the bad times and prepare yourself what things feel like they are going too well.

Don‚Äôt hesitate to dm me if there is anything I can help you with. We‚Äôre all on this crazy ride together.

God bless.

Thank you to everyone who shared their stories or sent their kind words. 

I hope that this post does not glamorize suicide attempts in any way. Yes I tried, but that doesn‚Äôt delegitimize the suffering of someone who hasn‚Äôt. Just because you haven‚Äôt attempted doesn‚Äôt make your situation any less valid or serious compared to anyone else‚Äôs. Remember my words above: a suicidal persons warped sense of reality tells them that suicide is a better option than reaching out for help. It is not. Ever.

Many of you have reached out to me in a PM and I thank you for reaching out to someone. I am always a friend in need to someone but I am not a professional. There are REAL professionals out there making a difference just waiting to be the change you need in your life. Remember the best thing you can do is reach out.

In all honesty, that thought brings me comfort. I dont think im a bad person. Sure, ive done shitty things, im human, like you (I assume). But this mindset is what has gotten me through some rough shit. 

2019 Is my worst year to date. August 24, a good friend who I really looked up to, committed suicide. I credit him to be a big part in preventing my own suicide. Then in November a great uncle and a high school classmate, both i was very fond of, passed within a couple days of each other. Then December 10, my grandma passed after a stroke the week prior. Her husband, my grandpa passed in May 2020. 

That was a bad time, as you can imagine. I had never lost anyone I was ever close to before then. My friends suicide being the big thing im still struggling with today. But whenever I have a beer, or some liquor, I pour one out in his/their name. 

I like to imagine my friend in Valhalla. As of all the afterlives that I know of, thats where he belongs. As he is a fucking legend. He lost his battle with depression, but he fought fucking hard. I still laugh and smile at the thought of him in any afterlife yelling at whoever is in charge because they don't understand the rules of whatever afterlife Pathfinder game he's running. 

And I like to think that wherever he, my grandparents, my old high school buddy, and my great uncle may be. When I pour one out, a beautiful mug full of that liquid is presented to them. 

Which that thought is made better by the fact that often times, im drinking really shitty cheap booze. And they look up from wherever they are and are just kinda ""what the fuck? You pour one out in mourning and im stuck with your shitty 1 dollar beer?"" 

I dont know, just a thought that may help someone in mourning. Hang in there, stranger. No matter how shitty life gets, it will always get better.  And despite the fact that life will get shitty again at some point, it WILL get better again. 

Hang in there.",https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/kuvptu/i_like_to_think_whenever_you_pour_one_out_for_a/,"I like to think, whenever you ""pour one out"" for a friend or family member who has passed, in whatever afterlife you picture them in, a cup appears in front of them and they get to drink whatever you poured out for them.",Opinion / Thoughts,496,36,0.99

Story time.   


Before Covid hit I was a leasing agent for a large Canadian REIT.  I was important, I was valued, I was paid very well. I had everything I wanted. I was fortunate enough to be sent to Calgary to launch one of the largest private student housing projects in Canadian history. Was a big big deal in the industry. Then Covid came along and decimated the Student housing industry. 50% of our clients were international and of the remaining 50% being domestic, only a small fraction of those were 'locally domestic' You can imagine what losing 90% of your paying clients can do for a project.  


I lost my job and came home defeated. My mental health suffered. My physical health suffered. My relationship suffered. I wasn't working, I wasn't a partner anymore. My girl left me in Dec.   


Things were hard. I was alone, I'm very much an introvert. The only people I talk to are people via Reddit or random women on dating apps. There's nobody I could call to come over and hang out with. Nobody I could call if I was having a dark moment. And there were many dark moments let me tell you.   


Winter blues is a thing. I'm a huge believer in that. I was living in a basement apartment that my ex and I shared before she left. I was so immobile emotionally and physically that for 5 months after she left I couldn't bring myself to removing anything she left behind. She took the cats, but the cat food sat in its dish for months. Her clothes still hung in the closet the way she left them. Every day was a dark dank lonely sad existence. I knew I needed a change. I had to change my outlook, my direction, my goals.   


I started talking to people on dating apps. I had no intention of seeing anyone. I just needed to talk to people again. That helped. I also started being more active on Reddit, that helped too. I like talking with people, I like giving advice. Small uptick in mental health after this.   
Then the sun started coming out. The grey dirty snow started going away. It was the end of April. Forced myself to go outside, even for a minute. Even for that very short walk to get milk. Instead of ordering it I went and got it. Small uptick in mental health after this.   
I got closure with my ex. Finally. Small uptick here.   


I needed something drastic though.   


So, voluntary homelessness. I left my apartment. I rented a room, and when that went to shit I started living out of my car. Waking up in the bush, next to a river, down by the ocean did wonders. Not caring or worrying about anything. Nothing at all, just being entirely selfish in my needs, my mental health. Huge uptick. I started smiling again. I started feeling better about everything. 

&#x200B;

Was going to spend the entire summer living outta my car. Then one random night I applied for a building manager job. Its become so much more than that.   


I was just given a job offer for a leasing agent role AND a building manager role. For a smaller REIT, but this position will require me to be very mobile. I could be driving 3hrs away to one of our buildings. I will never sit in an office. The company car is my office.   


Its going to be a couple weeks before I can afford an apartment, or I might just continue to live out of my car. Which may be tough because I'll also have a company car. So we'll see what happens there.   


But huge huge uptick. Motivation is high. Excitement is high. Self worth is high. I'm valued again. They were hugely impressed with my skill set, and its feels so damn good to be valued again.   


I wanted to share this because I've said to 100s of people on this very same sub that things can change, but you need to be the catalyst for that change. Nobody is going to come along and place change at your feet. You are responsible for everything that happens in your life, regardless of what has happened in your life. Wake up tomorrow, forge forward, make a small change in your life and allow it to snowball.   


Things are on an uptick now, but things dont get any easier. With this uptick comes a tremendous amount of responsibility. People are invested in me. This motivates me. I'll wake up tomorrow for my first day with a tremendous amount of energy and enthusiasm but will have to know and understand that a downtick can come at anytime. I'll deal with those when they come, I'm not going to worry about something that hasn't happened yet.   


Forward progress. Be the catalyst for change and personal growth. Have your pity party. Be sad. Have regret. But you gotta get over it, you gotta find closure and move on because the world will continue to spin without you. May aswell spin with it amirite?",https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/o0zh4u/new_job_still_homeless_but_i_got_a_new_job_mental/,New job! Still homeless but I got a new job!

I do the best I can but she still fucking overfeeds them so my two new kittens are going to be overweight and sick like the rest of my animals. 

If I show any sign of disagreement which is basically fucking impossible because she will literally say ""look how fat theyre getting isnt it cute"" and I cant help but look miserable or telling her that what shes doing is wrong. She will threaten to kick me out to move in with my dad which she has done multiple times before. I cant stay there because the whole house is covered in mould and I have breathing issues because Ive been smoking cigarettes, weed, heroin, pills, suboxone and tons of other crap since I was 12 years old. My breathing is so fucked I am constantly aware of my lungs and just breathing fresh air makes me feel so disgusted to be alive. I have an infection in my mouth and another in my sinus, which I basically have permanently because of the fucked up structure of my face.

Im not taking drugs anymore but I still smoke a cigarette every few days and I am so guilty because no matter how hard I seem to try, I cant even take care of myself. 

I live in fucking sydney where the house and rent prices are so fucked even if could find a trade or work I wouldnt be able to move out. The only person I had that understood and was there with me through all this shit was raped and murdered almost two years. He was my best fucking friend, the only person my age that I had been friends with in 6 years. My other best and only friend is addicted to fucking heroin and has aspergers so he just jumps to conclusions and gets mad at me if I show him any sort of emotion about things that are going on in my life, he just thinks im weak. I stopped seeing him because hes a horrible fucking influence. but I end up visiting him every week because i want social contact, but I just end up regretting it and leaving his house after an hour.

Ive recently been diagnosed with fucking epilepsy so thats fun. I have seizures when I dont get enough sleep, and I cant because my mum is fucking yelling or if im at my dads house he is up all night singing and working. Literally all night he sleeps from 6 am to 4 pm. So im constantly worried about having a siezure and I try so hard to get good sleep. So recently my sleeps been good enough that I dont think im at seizure risk, but still bad enough that my health is on a strong and steady decline. 

My brother doesnt talk to me, hes becoming an alcoholic. I mean hes been drinking everyday for the past year, but atleast hes stopped stealing off me and doesnt threaten to beat me up everytime I make eye contact with him anymore. 

I really dont want to kill myself but I have felt so bad my whole life and I cant seem to turn it around that I think if it keeps going it will be the only reasonable option.

I‚Äôve found them before but always months after the fact. The last time he wrote something it was an update saying he was still standing and things were looking up. But this time it was a goodbye note. And that everything he thought was looking up was just a delusion.

cmefq1,mentalhealth,1565027989.0,"When I was 13 (around the early 2000s) my parents got worried as I was making the transition from elementary school to middle school. They had me see a psychiatrist who did no testing or talking with me before writing me a prescription for some SSRIs. The dosage was very high and my parents weren't told to taper me on or off. 


I had intense sleepiness, trouble caring about things, trouble remembering my friends' names. I slept so deeply that I didn't even wake up to my body's signals to use the bathroom; I was a teenaged boy pissing his own bed. My grades plummeted and that made my parents simply insist on higher doses. The psychiatrist I was seeing wrote those prescriptions too, still never looked me in the eye. 


I knew something was wrong, but it was months before I could focus enough to tell my parents. Luckily they listened and I never had to take those pills again. But for the next 18 years I went through life blaming myself for not adjusting to a new school quickly enough or well enough. When I was old enough to make my own appointments, I spent hours and hours (and hundreds of dollars) getting evaluated for every possible mental illness. I even had blood tests. All the tests came back saying I was normal and healthy, but it still tugged at me. 


A few weeks ago I found the courage to find that psychiatrist and then I wrote him a letter asking for an apology. I was respectful, stating the facts of the matter first and then moving on to how it made me feel in the years afterward. I was clear that I only wanted an apology, but didn't want to smear his reputation or harm him. I told him that he could reply or he could not, and if he didn't reply I wouldn't bother him further. 


Today he found me via Facebook and apologized. The relief and the confirmation I felt was nearly overwhelming.

I‚Äôve wondered this for years. I‚Äôve always had a panic disorder. During my first terrible panic attack at 21, I remember googling different mental health facilities in the area and limited info came up. I ended up calling the cops because I was afraid and felt like I couldn‚Äôt breathe, but knew it was psychological. The cops showed up and the only assistance they provided was suggesting that I sat in the back seat of their car. I felt ashamed sitting there, and as my panic dissipated, I just remember feeling hollow and empty. They couldn‚Äôt help me and unless I was truly a danger to myself or others, they weren‚Äôt going to commit me to any psych wards. So, they left and told me some ‚Äúmobile counselors‚Äù would be on the way.

Eventually, I went back home and sat alone for 3 hours, trying to relax. These ‚Äúmobile‚Äù counselors the cops said they would provide me with decided to give me a call and ask if I still wanted help. By that time I was fatigued, so I declined.

That‚Äôs when I came up with this question. At that moment I would‚Äôve loved to just walk into a place and talk to a counselor on-call. Not days or weeks of waiting to talk to a psychiatrist or therapist, nor being committed to a psych ward. Just real people with crises that they need help with.

Helplines, in my personal opinion, aren‚Äôt the same type of treatment. I‚Äôve only tried a couple though, so I‚Äôm not entirely certain on it. Though, in some cases, slight medication intervention might be necessary, and personally I prefer a face-to-face conversation.

Money, jewelry, and other valuables kept going missing around the house. At first my mother blamed my two older sisters, and would beat them every time something went missing.

One day my mom found her necklace in the maid's work bag. When I came home from school the house was a complete mess. There was so much blood everywhere. I never saw the girl again. I didn't want to believe it for so long, but for some reason last night it snapped and I had a panic attack alone in my apartment. Growing up, my mother was abusive and always went into these white hot flashes of rage where she'll claim not to remember anything after. I don't want to believe it, but I know she's capable of this. She broke a doll house over my sister's back. She dipped a towel in boiling water and then wrapped it around my neck to get me to stop complaining about the neck pain I was having. If I misbehaved in school, she would beat me until my lips bled and tell me to ""watch myself bleed"" in the mirror. I know she can do this

I usually walked 20-30 minutes each day at first. Then the last 4-5 days I walked around hour. First it was just a nice break from being stuck indoor.

She asked to borrow one of my books and I peeled myself off my bed to grab it. It was only when I went to tell her to leave did I actually bother to look at her.

This lead to a short uncomfortable conversation of me asking if she was okay. We didn‚Äôt talk much. Instead I just asked her if she wanted to sit on the couch with me and watch a movie. I got her a blanket and some tissues. The whole movie we just sat there, at first crying and just holding hands by the end.

iyfkhv,mentalhealth,1600884732.0,"I have struggled with mental illness my entire life. I was diagnosed with severe anxiety as a child, depression at 14, ADHD at 16, and bipolar disorder at 20. The first time I seriously considered suicide was when I was 10. Needless to say, it‚Äôs been rough.

The pandemic hit me especially hard. In June I quit my job of 6 years due to the effect it was having on my mental health. I was supposed to work at a summer camp in July anyways, but the governor decided the day before I was supposed to start that residential camps would not be running this year. Due to me quitting my previous job I wasn‚Äôt eligible for unemployment, so I was no longer able to afford a therapist or my medication.

I found a new job in July but my mental health had declined to the point where I was completely unable to do it. It also involved driving to a different facility every day, which would cause me to vomit with anxiety before every shift. After having a panic attack over parking in Boston, I ghosted them and decided that this was the end for me. I couldn‚Äôt do something as simple as sit and stare at a pool for 8 hours, even if the alternative was an empty bank account and a rising self-hatred. How would I ever be able to function independently?

That night I attempted to hang myself. Obviously, it didn‚Äôt work, and I‚Äôm still here. This frustrated me; I felt like such a failure that I couldn‚Äôt even succeed in dying. I ended up relapsing with self harm, and I spent the weeks after that consuming any substance I could get my hands on to numb the pain, waiting for the courage to try again.

After the very much warranted disappointment from my parents, I ended up applying for an overnight warehouse job for an online retailer. From the rumors I‚Äôd heard I expected it to suck, but they were right, I needed a job.

They hired me, and I started last week. Turns out it doesn‚Äôt suck. And I don‚Äôt suck at the job either. Within three days they asked me to apply for a promotion, and today I got a fancy new vest, my shift differential was bumped up by $1.50, and I finally have some hope for the future. I also found out if I stay for a year they can help pay for my education, so for the first time in forever I have a long-term plan for my future. Best of all, I can afford to get help again.

I know I‚Äôm going to feel shitty again, but it‚Äôs going to get better again after that. I have trouble remembering times like these when I‚Äôm really going through it, but for the first time in years I feel capable. I feel like I can take it. I‚Äôm a hard worker and I‚Äôm no quitter, why would I give up on life like that?

I guess my point is that no matter how dark it seems, how hopeless it feels, or how incompetent you think you are, there‚Äôs always a chance for it to get better. I‚Äôm moreso making this post to look back on the next time I‚Äôm suicidal, but I‚Äôm hoping my message will help others a little.

For a brief moment in my life from ages 15 to the summer before I turned 17, I lived with my dad and his girlfriend. My dad was a passive, quiet guy that wasn't around much. He didn't want custody, but accepted to take me and my brother who was 12 at the time to live with him while my mom was in Europe taking care of someone. The whole situation was odd. This woman, let's call her C, had an 11 year old son and was not happy about two more kids being added onto her plate. My dad promised we were no trouble and that I was old enough not to need babysitting.

I was rebellious, like most 15 year olds. I was energetic, popular, and sporty. I had just broken up with my boyfriend, and I was just starting high school. Things are already horrible, and to add a stranger to the mix was ever more shitty. After we moved out and went back to live with my mother, I was never the same person. I told my therapist that I wanted to go back to that 15 year old girl again. I was so happy and fun. He asked me to describe when things changed, and this all came up...

This woman legit abused me, and nobody said anything. Nobody defended me, and I blamed myself. I thought I was troubled, that I was difficult, that it was my fault, that my dad didn't like me.

I bleached the lower part of my hair and colored it hot pink. When she found out, she dragged me to the bathroom and locked the door and stood in front of it. She didn't let me out until I cut the parts I had bleached. My hair went from almost above my bra to shoulder length. It looked horrible too. All the while, this large woman with shaved tattooed eyebrows stood behind me and yelled at me.

*Your father will blame me for this! What an idiot! I should just make you cut it all off! Either you do it or I'll do it for you!*

I clearly remember shaking and cutting my hair. She made me clean the bathroom, explain to my dad that I had made a mess of my hair and had to do this and apologize for it.

She convinced my dad not to let me go on a 3-day school trip because she thought I must be grounded for a month because I had stolen her wifi password. Her stupid 0000 wifi password. She said that I couldn't be trusted, and how could my dad let me go on this trip? So, I was grounded and not allowed to go - and I was the ONLY freshman not there.

She took my phone and only gave it back when I called my mom crying about it and she had to have a fight with dad from across the world. Finally, my dad decided my phone was out of the question.

The worst thing, aside from the hair, was when my friends and I decided to go to a party when I was 16. We got ready at our place, and were just leaving when she stopped us yelling and screaming.

*Why would you think it's ok to leave my house looking like a whore? get back here!*

And then she dragged me back to the house and pushed me to my room, legit attacked me and took off my clothes and made me wipe off my make-up and change into something else. My friends were frozen out of fear, I came out looking beaten (she didn't actually hit me, though) and miserable and crying. I just told them to just go - and we all ran out of that house. I was humiliated. I wanted to die. My friends didn't know what to do. One of them asked if she always treated me like that. ""What a bitch""

That night, she came into my room to let me know she only did that because she cares about my dad and what he thinks of her. Also that she doesn't want her son to see these things at his age!

She did that a lot. Randomly talking to me about what a great person she was and how wise she was. Once she sat me down to tell me I was acting out and that she knew I was a good girl deep down, but trying to fight her and that it was natural. She made me feel crazy and ungrateful. She would play the victim constantly. My dad was barely there, much like before, but when he was - he was yelling at me because she'd told him I was nothing but trouble.

She broke my spirit. I was too tired to fight her. I gave up fighting her, I just legit gave up. When I told these to my therapist, he said that abuse is exactly like this. They close a door on you, but don't teach you how to open another one... so you're just lost. I needed someone to love me, to pay attention, to tell me I was doing a good job getting straight A's in school. Instead, I got constant yelling and criticism and guilt.

I'm 26 years old now... and I've just realized what this monster has done to me. She's the reason my life is miserable now. I wasn't a bad kid. I wasn't a trouble maker. I was just a teenager, and this woman made it her mission to break me and she did. My dad never married her, and I have no idea what's happened to her. I've also never told my mom. I mean, she knew that I was having ""trouble"" but I never told her my side of the story.

I don't know how I'm going to overcome this, but I'm done feeling like the victim. I now know why I'm no longer happy and care-free and energetic. I know exactly when things changed. I'm the same person, I just had a door closed on my face and nobody showed me how to open another one. I'm gonna build one and walk through it now. Fuck you, C. I hope you get what you deserve. I'm sure she kept telling herself she was being ""responsible"" or that was her job - but all she had to do was NOT ruin some kid's life.

IMPORTANT EDIT: I just need to say this, since this is getting some reads... Please please please if you just don't feel good - that doesn't necessarily mean sad or angry, it could just be ""out of it"" - try and find the reason for it. I've tried for years. I've been in therapy since I was 17, and I started cutting myself. I used to think it was because of guys, or because of my parents' divorce, or because of x and y and... I only realized what this was all about when I told my therapist that the last time I was truly happy was when I was 15. He made me write about every single year of my life, and we went through it like a TV show and figured out what exactly happened. I didn't even think of this woman for much of my adult life. But now, everything's a lot clearer. So - just please talk to someone. Write. Writing is incredible, and it doesn't even cost anything. But if you write and talk to someone who knows what to look for - that's what matters.

egu3ge,mentalhealth,1577557210.0,"Kind of an inflammatory title but it comes with a story and a bit of advice so buckle in.

Growing up I didnt have any problems with mental health. I was raised southern Baptist, worked on cars with my dad while still in diapers. When I could walk I learned home improvement, drywall, painting, ect. I was raised to be strong, protect my sisters and my mom. I was raised that men dont cry, men dont hurt. I grew up thinking that I had to be strong in all moments and never let down my guard. 

Fast forward to 2 years ago. I was driving home on the not so good side of town very very late at night when I saw a guy leaning in the window of a car. (Drug deals not uncommon out in the open) He turned away from the car and jerked violently before falling down onto the street. I slammed my car to a stop, threw up the brake and jumped out, not knowing what was happening. 

I always carry a firearm on me and had it on my side. I approached the male laying on the ground when the guys from the car he was leaning in opened their door. When they stood up the only thing I remember seeing was the barrel of their gun. Couldn't tell you what they looked like, what color the car was, hell even if it was a guy or a girl. I pulled my weapon when I saw this and we both paused for what felt like hours, days. I wasnt breathing. We just started at each other while I was aimed dead in that person's chest. 

I didnt pull the trigger.

The person jumped back in their car and sped off after what seemed like an eternity and I holstered my weapon and ran to the guy in the street. He was shot in the lower left of his back, blood pumping out of a small circle wound. Holding pressusre on it with one hand and trying to dial 911 with the other I tried to stop and much bleeding as possible. After hanging up with 911 the wait began. 

I took my jacked off and laid it under him. (With it being cold out and him losing blood you want to keep his core as warm as possible. Help arrived almost exactly 1 hour later. My hand had frozen, literally frozen to this mans skin in a frozen seal of blood. 

Greg was his first name and he made a full recovery.

I moved on from that day different. Over the course of the next year I would have night terrors of the image of that gun, the blood pumping out of his skin, being alone with him desperately trying to keep him alive. I couldn't be in public with out my heart racing and having to leave. I didnt trust new people I was meeting. I was scared to be alone at any times. It came to a head when I tried to end everything. 

With out going into it to much I didnt. I went straight to family for help and explained everything. My mom took me in, I found a therapist that I enjoyed and got put on a medication to calm the terrors. The first time I talked to the therapist I cried. I cried and cried for the first time in my life. Cried like a baby and let all the manly machismo go. I was vulnerable and she held me through it. She understood and didnt judge. She saved me.

One year of therapy later I have a totally different outlook on mental health. After reading through this sub I figured this story could help someone. It is okay for men to hurt. It doesnt make you less of a man to be struggling with something. It is okay to break down and not have the solutions. 

Please, if you are someone who thinks you will be judged negatively for having ""something wrong"" or being broken in some way, there is help. I am forever grateful I found help when I did.

11sry7b,mentalhealth,1678967728.0,"So I've had anxiety ever since I can remember. I was scared of going blind at 7 years old, scared the world was gonna end when I was 11, etc. I think I would've been much better off today if I was taught what anxiety was when I was much younger. Then I would know how to deal with it, learn that I wasn't crazy, and most of all, get the help I needed before my brain was fully developed. 
In my opinion, I think with the amount of people in the world that struggle with some type of mental illness, kids should start learning about them at a much younger age so that their world doesn't fall apart one day and they have no idea why or how to deal with it. So many people are also too afraid to ask for help because they are embarrassed, scared of being judged, or don't have the money/resources for help. Just imagine how many people could've benefited from being helped earlier on, how many people could've been saved.

nwmpz1,mentalhealth,1623329096.0,"I'm getting really sick of people who are all about Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and Positive Psychology and think having a positive attitude is the end all be all of mental health treatment. There are many people who benefit from this type of therapy, don't get me wrong, but the people who are suffering most often see it as writing them off. If you are deep in poverty, in an abusive relationship, jobless, homeless, or preoccupied with messages from voices you hear, these methods do not work. Therapists need to take this into account when working with people who fit into these categories, but also initially with all patients. There should be an understanding that people aren't very open at first in therapy in general and could have any of these things going on and not tell you. Simply saying you need to change your thoughts doesn't work. People may be in situations where their thoughts are about real problems they need to face every day. I understand trying to make it easier for that person and that is what you think you're doing, but really you are just making your job easier. You, as a therapist, would be much better off starting with asking what kind of therapy someone is looking for and describing the different forms if necessary. Different forms fit different people and I'm sick of CBT being the gold standard. 

It really makes my blood boil when I hear someone say their therapist doesn't listen, and most of the time it's because they are trying to use CBT and Positive Psychology where they don't belong. Sometimes life really is hard for that person, and trying to get them to think differently about it is an exercise in futility. People are often quietly in crisis, and I see these approaches as inherently dismissive of this fact.

He made me chat with adults on the internet. He pretended that I was his sister. He talked about threesomes with me and strangers. He justified it to himself. He got off to these fantasies, under a blanket, thinking I didn't notice.

He laid on the couch with me. He asked if I was too warm, and if I wanted to take off my clothes. I said no. He touched my stomach and told me I was soft. He told me I was beautiful, that I had a soft back. He asked if I wanted to take off me clothes. I said no. It felt like forever before he gave up.

I will never forgive that betrayal.

I will never forgive him for putting these thoughts and these abnormal fantasies in my head.

I had prepared quite well for the appointment, I had brought a list of the maybe-diagnoses my psychologist had given me and the corresponding symptoms. (For context: she diagnosed a medium depression, depersonalisation- and derealization syndrome, hallucinations and possibly psychosis)

When I said I brought a list, he said he'd rather I tell him about it myself. Fair enough, I tried to. He interrupted me before I could get into the second diagnosis on my list, telling me not to use words like ""depersonalisation"" for myself. Those words are for people that are really sick, not people like me. 

He kept asking me what my boyfriend does and if he's mentally stable, if I'm happy with him. The appointment was supposed to last an hour, we were done in 15 minutes because he didn't ask me anything about me. He dismissed everything I said I was experiencing, he said I was making myself more sick than I actually was. He said I was a really sensitive, frail person and I shouldn't use medical terms to describe my symptoms. 

He ended the appointment with a well-loved classic, I need to go on runs, it works just as well as an anti-depressant! I have chronic back issues and am not supposed to run. I told him that and got the ""stop making yourself more sick than you are, you're young and healthy"" speech again.

I'm so exhausted, that was such a terrible appointment and I feel so stupid now. I'll never go there again.

The only times that I feel OK are when I'm stoned, like right now. And - rarely- when very comfortable with friends in a loving home environment. I never felt like this once while I was living with my parents.

I gave up a lot to feel better, I even quit my job and left everything behind on a spiritual journey, and yet after a lot of (enjoyable) adventures I still feel the same. Like life is just a movie playing in front of my eyes, as though a dream which I have no will over. I never felt in control of my life, really.

back to my point, everyone deserves help and a chance to change their life for the better, so I implore you please god get help sooner or later. trust me it won't just disappear if you leave it.

I have always been of strong character and hard working, people who know me would say I'm life and soul, funny, intelligent and strong. Recently though I've found myself slipping into a routine of staying up late and sleeping all day and being lazy. I cocoon myself in my duvet and wrap a pillow around my head and try to sleep as long as possible. I can wake momentarily and remember my dreams quite vividly (they are always enjoyable happy dreams) I can then just remember the dream and slip back into them. 

It's like I'm addicted to my dreams and as soon as I wake I try and try to enter back into that world. Sometimes I'm successful but after 12 hours sadly I am in the real world. 

I am in danger of losing my job because of this now which worries me even more. It's quite apparent that I must be depressed. I have so much to be grateful for but it appears the big D has taken over my life. Can I regain my normal life?

bs77u9,mentalhealth,1558639977.0,"First time posting here, please don‚Äôt mind the rambly-ness of this. Today I was thinking about something that happened years ago that made me realize schools don‚Äôt do much about suicidal students. 

When I was in high school I was severely depressed and going through a really difficult time in my life due to my parents divorce, particularly after being sent to live with my neglectful and abusive dad. I was self harming, battling an eating disorder, and was barely sleeping at night. I was absolutely struggling pretty clearly on the outside. I had a teacher tease me for looking so miserable at school every day and I got in trouble for being inattentive or dozing off in classes among my high-achieving peers. It was a rough time. 

I remember changing a password to something I accessed at school to iwannadie. It must have been flagged because I was sent to my guidance counselor, who really only ever gave people advice and help with applying to college, and she basically got me in trouble and threatened to tell my parents, and made me sign a contract that I wouldn‚Äôt kill myself. It totally cured me of all depression and I was never suicidal again! /s

Anyway, it upsets me that they didn‚Äôt do anything more about this. They didn‚Äôt mention it to my parents or anyone else, they never followed up again, and didn‚Äôt have a therapist or a professional to refer me to, in school or out. 

Schools need to have a resource for students. I was so vulnerable and depressed and I was shamed for it rather than helped. Guidance counselors don‚Äôt really have time for this, which is understandable, but they MUST have someone else there to support students during tough times if that‚Äôs the case.",https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/bs77u9/high_schools_need_therapists_and_real_resources/,"High schools need therapists and real resources for suicidal students, not just non-suicide contracts",,449,28,1.0

hdnt0e,mentalhealth,1592811682.0,"I‚Äôm from an Indian (India not Native American) family. They were born in India, but I was born here in the United States. I‚Äôve lived here in the Southeast for my whole life. I‚Äôve always faced so much racism. I‚Äôve been called a terrorist for my skin color more times than I can remember. 

The media so often uses us as the butt of jokes (looking at you Disney Channel) and even some politicians do too. Joe Biden made a joke about Indians being gas station owners (my parents are lawyers with American accents). Nobody cares though. I‚Äôm just expected to suck it up. 

I tried so hard to look at the bright side. To look at how much opportunity and financial success this country has provided, and that is something I will always be very grateful for. I tried so hard to love this nation, but I just can‚Äôt. I‚Äôve been told to ‚Äúgo home‚Äù by some people. Despite being born here and living here my whole life, I‚Äôll never be seen as a true American. 

Despite that I just can‚Äôt stand it any more. It‚Äôs not the racism so much, but the indifference and invalidation. That‚Äôs the real depressive thing. 

Anyway, this isn‚Äôt to say that all Americans are like this. I‚Äôve met plenty of fantastic ones who understand and sympathize, but there are just too many of the bad apples in this country for me to want to stay. 

I was lucky enough to intern in, and get a full time job in London. I‚Äôm so ecstatic to move there. The fact that I‚Äôm ethnically Indian won‚Äôt be my defining factor there like it is here. At least there I‚Äôll be ‚Äúthe American‚Äù and not ‚Äúthe Indian.‚Äù 

Systemic Barriers like racial preferences in college admissions don‚Äôt exist at top universities like they do here. I went to college at UVA, and while it was leagues better than high school in terms of overt racism, the invalidation and indifference of overt racism toward ethnic Indians was still 100% there. So if I have kids, they‚Äôll grow up in a country where their skin color isn‚Äôt their defining factor.

n5fucd,mentalhealth,1620221048.0,"November 2020 my best friend(17F) committed suicide. It was honestly one of the most traumatic things I've ever had to go through, and my boyfriend(18M) and I also broke up about a week after her death. (Just to clarify, he didn't break up with me because he didn't want to deal with me going through my best friend's suicide. Our breakup was a long time coming, it just unfortunately happened at a really bad time).

November through January was the most difficult time of my life. I struggled so so much. I think I had so much trauma from that time, that I literally cannot remember a single thing from those two and a half months. I just remember this constant feeling of numbness and having a breakdown every couple of days. I missed my ex-boyfriend and I missed my best friend so so much. Somehow I've lost my two best friends, the two most important people in my life only eight days apart. It was awful. 

I'm doing much much better now. I've made new friends, I've kissed new boys, I'm going to social events with my friends (Covid is currently under control in my country, don't worry xx). I've realized that breaking up with my now ex-boyfriend was one of the best things I've EVER done for myself. Please don't get me wrong, he's a phenomenal person with a beautiful heart. I still have so much love for him, but we weren't meant to be together in the long run, and I've realized that now. Our relationship became toxic, not because either of us were toxic individuals, but because we weren't good for each other anymore. 

As for my best friend... Zara my beautiful beautiful angel. I miss you every day, but I know how much pain you were in. This world didn't deserve you, sunflower-child. I still feel you everywhere around me. I feel you when the sun hits my back when I'm laughing with my friends at school, I feel you when I'm making out with younger boys on golf courses and I know you would've approved. I feel you around me when I'm drinking beers with my boys and dancing with my girls.  You're always around, I know it!

I miss you so much, but I know you're in a place where you're happy, and that you're finally at a place where you don't have pain and where you can truly be yourself. I love you, you selfless and kind person.

These are more admirable traits than 'perfect'.  


What is perfect anyway?  


That you can edit photos for social media well?  


That you hide your emotions and feelings behind clothes, makeup and good poses?

clgnjp,mentalhealth,1564822163.0,"Those are the words of my 9 year old son. Words he spoke the other day because he misses his 17 year old cousin who died by suicide 16 months ago. He wants to see her. Words I now carry with me every moment of every day. 

I was there that morning. I arrived right after the police. It was like a scene in a movie. Emergency lights flashed from every direction. I left my car in the middle of the road, door open, pushed past all the police in the street, and ran into the house. 

Looking back on that day I can see myself as if I was watching from above. My sister and her husband were inconsolable.  Police everywhere. The screams, and tears. All the phone calls. It‚Äôs such a blur. But what is clear are the moments I was able to sit with her before she was taken away. The quiet in her room was deafening. I wanted it all to stop. I wanted to turn back the clock. To have one more chance. As I sat there the realization hit me like wave. Everything had changed. I couldn‚Äôt stop it. Nothing would ever be the same again. My niece... she was gone. 

It‚Äôs been sixteen months and no one has ‚Äúmoved on‚Äù.  It‚Äôs something we carry with us every day. It‚Äôs part of all of us. That loss, the grief, the anger and disbelief. It makes every step harder to make and every breath harder to take. 

My niece was in pain. Blinding pain. I sat on the front steps that morning and read the note she left. 10 pages of writing as the drugs took effect. She was more afraid of waking up then dying. Those were her exact words!  She was only two months shy of 18, yet she couldn‚Äôt see the light her future held. Any hope she had gathered over time had slipped through her fingers. She couldn‚Äôt hold on any longer. 

I‚Äôm grateful that her pain has stopped but I wish she could have seen or felt the love she was leaving behind. The devastation that has ripped through our family is the result of the tremendous love we all felt for her.  She was our light. She brought so much joy to us all. Yet she struggled to feel any herself. 

Life will never be the same. People tell you that things will get better in time. A big part of me wants to scream that I don‚Äôt want everything to be ok because it‚Äôs not.  We‚Äôre not and never will be. We‚Äôre all a mess. My kids still struggle every day.  She was a regular part of their life. She loved them unconditionally and them her. How do you explain why this disease could take her away and why we couldn‚Äôt help her.  They are too young to have to deal with anxiety and depression, and loss. 

What I wouldn‚Äôt give for another chance to reach her. Knowing the pain she was in crushed my soul. She had the most beautiful heart. If only she could have felt how loved she was. 

If you are struggling with depression or thinking about suicide, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE reach out for help. You are not alone. You deserve to feel love and happiness. You might not feel it or see it right now but there are people who care, who see your worth, who understand your pain, and want to help.  You can even confidentially call or text counselors who can help. I posted the link below.

I'm a 20-year-old woman from Newcastle, UK, and I'm reaching out for help. When I was 16, I moved to the UK with my mother from Poland, and since then, life has been a constant struggle.  
  
My father left us when I was young, and I haven't had any contact with him for years. My mother's severe mood swings resemble extreme bipolar episodes, but she refuses to seek any help, making my life even harder.  
  
Last year, I was prescribed Roaccutane for my acne, and things took a turn for the worse. Due to COVID, my doctor increased my dose without necessary blood tests, and I became extremely ill. My mother's refusal to pay for my treatment made things worse, and I was suicidal, but I managed to hang on.  
  
Yesterday, my mother had her worst episode yet. While drunk, she threatened me and got very close. Terrified for my safety, I locked the door behind her when she went outside to smoke. Shockingly, she set the garden on fire, knowing it would spread to the house and harm me.  
  
I called the police, and my mother is now in custody. I'm completely alone, with no support, money, or idea of how to move forward. I can't work or study because of my condition.

We broke up about 6 months ago and have been living together as housemates till now and after finally moving out my sense of relief is so enormous I just want to cry. Even as housemates she was still super controlling and never gave me privacy or respect, she'd burst into my room at random moments without knocking, no matter what I was doing she would sit on my bed uninvited and talk for ages about herself to demand my attention and I was called rude if my replies weren't what she wanted. She'd never let me have a say or input about anything that went into the house, it was all just her decisions and that was final. 

I've just moved into a share house which I was terrified about since I've never lived with anyone else before and my new housemates are really lovely and welcoming and it actually feels like my place aswell. it's a weird feeling not having anyone to ""answer"" to any more but I guess it's the feeling of actual freedom! 

After narcissistic parents who were controlling and emotionally abusive too Its been a weird rough time getting to this point but my healing begins today.

Some time ago, I took one too many pills and was overdosing. My friends broke into my room and found me having a seizure. I was rushed to the E. R. 
I'm lucky to be here and will never touch drugs again. I went toy first therapy session last week and I have to tell you it was a great experience opening up and letting my feelings be heard.Felt really light after that. Just want to let you know that, if things are bad right now, you gotta stay and see how things turn out. They may turn out pretty good and it's crazy how the right people walk into your life at the right time.

Those same people complain about their friends that are being ""too negative"" , those same people brag about dropping certain friends because they spend too much time alone and¬† never want to hang out, those are the same people that are embarrassed to be seen with their friend in public because they have self harm scars and are wearing short sleeves. They literally think that depression is just being sad and anxiety is like just being nervous about an exam. They have this version in their heads of what mental illness is that's so far from what it actually is. They kind of glamorize it in a way but there is nothing glamorous about having a mental illness. 

Again I'm just speaking from experience but i know so many people like this and it really pisses me off, they advocate so much for mental health yet they know nothing about it. They don't even try to empathize or provide some support instead they actually want nothing to do with a mentally ill person, they judged you and they just try to push toxic positivity onto you. I recently got diagnosed with depression, general anxiety disorder and CPTSD. I've had friends call me gross because at one point my depression got so bad that I didn't showed in 4 days, I've had friends that called me dramatic when I almost had a panic attack in public, I've had friends that got angry at me for not wanting to watch a movie because certain scenes triggers my PTSD, I've had friends that judged for having suicidal thoughts and they told me that ""I should think happy thoughts"" or ""You shouldn't be so negative all the time"" or ""You should be grateful because your life isn't as bad as others"". 

Those are the same people that are apart of all the mental health groups/clubs at my school and they post all over their social media for mental health awareness month and suicide prevention month but in reality they don't care about any of that. This person that I know that advocates so much for mental health once gave me a whole lecture because they thought that I was self diagnosing  (this was before I was actually diagrams with anything) and all I did was tell them that my mental health has been really bad and that I've been feeling depressed and struggled with anxiety for a really long time. I had to explain to them that you can still struggle with your mental health even if you're not diagnosed with any mental illness and they told me that I can't say that I'm feeling depressed without actually being diagnosed with depression.

I wrote this when I had a revelation about myself. I knew I've been depressed my whole life. I knew I had severe anxiety and I hated myself more than words can explain. But I thought it was completely my fault - that I was a broken person. I thought I would never heal. I thought nobody would ever understand me. I just recently realized that my childhood abuse has completely shaped who I am as an adult. I never before made the connection between my childhood abuse and who I am today. It wasn't simply just a ""chemical imbalance; end of story"".

I'm gonna vent about this because I know I'm not the only one. This is something that I just recently realized and it takes a lot of weight off my shoulders to finally know why I am the way I am. This was really an eye opener for me. This is my story. *TW*

The worst part about child abuse is for a lot of us, we are too young to understand that we're even being abused. Especially in terms of emotional abuse. We don't know any different. We grew up being treated like this, and we know something doesn't feel right, but we decide it must be a problem with us. ""We accept the love we think we deserve."" 
Thankfully I did know that the physical abuse I was receiving was not okay, but honestly it took me 24 years to fully realize that I was emotionally abused as a child. 24 YEARS.

I was emotionally and physically abused by my parents and other family members (mostly my mother) starting as a very very young child, possibly infant. Of course as a child you are incapable of understanding that you are not to blame. Because of this, I believed that I was broken, horrible, and stupid. I thought something was wrong with me. Why else would my parents not love me? In my own eyes I had to be at fault. Something was wrong with me. Even as a preschooler and kindergartener I have memories of thinking ""why do I have to be me?"" and ""what's wrong with me?"". My self esteem was non-existent. 

I remember going to my pediatric doctor due to a skin infection I had as a kindergartener. I had to see this doctor weekly, and because she was so kind to me (as a doctor should be, or any adult honestly) I started to see her as a parent figure. She made me feel loved and safe when my own mother did not. I remember I brought her a picture of me that we got from school picture day. She told my parents that I must have asperger's because of how socially awkward I was and how I acting around her (the doctor.) This later proved to be false, but again added to my feeling that I was broken and bad. We stopped seeing that doctor and my parents were furious at me. Why was it not clear to this doctor that I was insecurely attached?

My self esteem and hatred towards myself only got worse as time went on, and by 4th grade I was having full on almost passing out panic attacks. Started as hypochondria, but quickly became social anxiety. I could NOT function in school because I felt so uncomfortable in my own skin. Nobody wanted to be my friend. Nobody cared about me. The teachers HATED me. And then at home, nobody loved me. When people would look at me I wanted to just disappear. I made myself believe that I was incapable of making friends or being likable which in turn basically made me be unlikable. Ironic. Nobody wanted to be around me because my anxiety made me very awkward. I viewed myself as lesser than everyone else which would follow me into adulthood. Eventually I could not talk in front of the class. If I even knew I had to say a single word in front of the class or have everyone look at me I would literally run out of the room. Complete full on flight mode. Instead of being diagnosed with ANXIETY, I was diagnosed with ADHD. I couldn't focus because I was probably always disassociating. School was not the most important thing in my mind because at both at home and at school I was trying to survive. Why on earth would school be the first thing on my mind? 

Of course I fell behind in school and struggled to keep up with assignments which in turn made me feel even more stupid. When they had psychologists coming in to my classroom to study me, it only worsened my hatred towards myself. ""They're only watching me and studying me because there's something wrong with me."" I started seeing the school psychologist, therapist and social worker weekly. I was put into remedial classes and on an IEP. I was placed in some classes with children with severe behavioral and intellectual disabilities. I was forced to take IQ tests. In 6th grade I was literally forced to STACK BLOCKS while a psychologist watched. I'll never forget seeing the notes the psychologist wrote after that. ""Lots of nervous laughter."" No shit. I'm 12 and you're having me stack 5 blocks in a specific pattern. This is after they found out I had an average IQ, mind you. Everything that they did, whether they were trying to help or not, made me feel worse about myself. ""Why can't I be like the regular kids?"" is all that went through my brain. Every single thing that happened to me only solidified the belief in my head that something was wrong with me.

I was embarrassed of my own existence.

When I'd go home and try to explain that I would shake and be so scared that I couldn't even think straight in school my parents would just scream at me. I remember getting punched in the stomach and told to suck it up after just trying to explain what was going on. I had no one to turn to. 

By 7th grade I could not go to school. If I knew I'd have to work with other students or even be looked at in front of the class I would skip school. And honestly, it wasn't that school itself was a problem. I liked school itself. I couldn't function with my low self esteem and hatred towards myself. I constantly felt singled out. I felt bad that other people even had to look at me. I was too young to put this into words, and all I was able to say to anyone about what was going on was that talking in front of the class makes me scared and shakey. 

After I started getting in trouble for missing so much school (after the school social worker and principal drove to my house to talk to my parents and do a wellness check on my family), I went with extreme measures. Even running away from home and hiding which ended up with the police looking for me. All because I didn't want to have to panic. I tried to explain my anxiety in the best way a child can without even understanding what anxiety is. I was treated like a delinquent child instead.
Ended up in court after missing hundreds of days of school and had to do weeks of community service. AT 12 YEARS OLD.

I was showing so many signs of an abused child and I had definitely brought up my family physical abuse multiple times to adults at school and nobody heard me. Nobody. I was not a delinquent. I was suffering so noticeably yet somehow nobody noticed. 

By high school I refused to wear my glasses so I wouldn't have to see people looking at me in the hallway. I was still in remedial classes all those years later, which were mostly for kids with behavioral issues.  Kids that would kick, fight, scream, do drugs, you name it - this was not me at all.  I think I gave up trying to speak out because I tried so many times and I couldn't get anyone to hear me. I ended up dropping out of high school.

Fast forward to three years ago when I was going to pursue my dream of studying and then hopefully teaching abroad in Japan. Saved up for three years for my student visa and relearned everything from the ground up to get my GED. Did both things, got accepted and started my Japanese school in Tokyo. Never in my life had I been so proud of myself. I didn't even believe I was capable of accomplishing anything in my life. The moment that plane landed I cried my first ever happy tears.

Two weeks into language school, we were going around the table of probably 20 other students learning verbs at a very fast pace. I remember time slowing down while I was waiting for it to be my turn, then I blacked out. When I came to I ran out of the classroom. I left school and walked around Tokyo sobbing. I had gotten that far and somehow completely forgot how bad my self esteem and anxiety are. My dreams completely clouded out the truth. I knew I couldn't continue with school so I dropped out, then impulsively blew all of my tuition money that I saved for years on bullshit. After coming home I hit rock bottom and was hospitalized. Once again, the belief that I was broken was renewed in my mind.

At the hospital I was told ""you're not severe enough for inpatient treatment"". The doctor spent a total of maybe 4 minutes with me. Asked me a couple questions, checked me for head injuries, and left. I went to the hospital because I knew that if I went back home I was going to end my life. I was so used to stuffing my emotions down into myself at this point in my life that even if I was on the edge of ending it all - I looked calm. I even explained to them this. After waiting 6 hours after seeing the doctor, they sent me to a place thats only purpose was to keep you from harming yourself. Great, but when I went back home I learned nothing. No coping skills, didn't talk to a single mental health professional, nothing. I was back at square one. I reached out for help for the first time as an adult and was again, failed.

Inside my head was still the once tiny little girl wondering, ""what is wrong with me?""

Memories of my childhood were again, flashing back. I sat in my room for months. I couldn't leave the house. I had no desire to exist. I ripped up every baby photo I had with my mother in them. I honestly thought I wouldn't live another year. I was going to end up killing myself. I lost all of my hope.

Now, a couple years after that I'm finally now just getting the real help I need. I had to be the one to keep reaching out. It was very hard, but I am so glad I did. I had to keep picking myself back up, again and again; If I hadn't I would not be alive. I'm so glad that I chose to fight for my life. I searched for a long time for a good psychiatrist and therapist. I finally found someone who heard me. I have even been able to forgive people who abused me. Of course I still and always will have scars, but now I am able to cope with them. 
I now know I am not broken. I am a survivor and I have been and was just trying to survive. People are now shocked when I tell them I have ""social anxiety."" Eventually I will go back to Japan when I am actually ready. 

Learning about CPTSD and realizing WHY I am the way I am has been extremely important to me. Just like I'm finally connecting the dots. I'm finally starting to love myself. The little girl that once felt so unloved is finally healing. 

I encourage all of you to learn how your trauma affects you, and know that you can also heal from it. üíï I hope someone out there will read this and feel like there is hope. I truly hope this inspired someone out there that is in an awful place like I once was. Do not give up on yourself.

Please remember: You're not broken. You're surviving.

lxkry4,mentalhealth,1614865391.0,"Last Saturday, February 27th, was the one year anniversary of my ex cheating on me, I had really bad thoughts about harming her, like if I could end her life all my problems would be fixed. See, she was abusive to me and her cheating on me broke me mentally and sent me into a downward spiral that I thought was bipolar disorder. 

I had spoken with both my family doctor and a psychiatrist, and they both agreed that it seemed to be type 2 bipolar disorder. So, I started taking medicine for it. Now, let's jump back to last Saturday.

I realized these thoughts I were having were dangerous and that I needed serious help immediately, so I told my parents to take me to the hospital, being a bit vague on the details, and they did. I got to the ER and told the nurse everything that had been happening and I was sent to a bare room with only a boxed-in tv on the wall as an SIHI, meaning I was both suicidal and homocidal. 

The doctors at my hospital evaluated me and sent a report off to a bugger hospital an hour away that had a dedicated psych ward for patients like me. After 4 hours of waiting, I got the news that this better hospital would accept me as a patient. So, within 15min, I was in an ambulance and on my way to the psych ward.

When I arrived, I was immediately taken to a room where my vitals were recorded and my possessions were taken away, and I had to sign papers agreeing to treatment and their policies. Once I had completed the paperwork, I was made to put on a pair of no-slip socks for safety and was shown to my room. 

It was a fairly bare room, with just a desk to store what few clothes I could bring and two beds. I had to share my room with a nice old man named Arthur, who was there for mild schizophrenia. We also shared a simple bathroom with a toilet, sink, and shower. 

The operation of the psych ward were fairly simple. Meals were at 7:30, 11, and 4:30, and snacks were at 9, 2, and 8:30. We had ""group,"" at 10, 3, and 8 where we learned coping mechanism, positive thinking skills, and did occupational therapy to learn healthy hobbies and habits to give us an outlet for stress and creativity.

 They didnt force you to eat or go to group, though. Some of the patients only came out for meals and slept the rest of the day. Most of us stayed in the common room which had a water fountain and tv. We ended up watching HGTV or the Food Network most of the time. We did watch some Star Wars, too,  which was nice

Each shift change, a new nurse was assigned to you, and they were all very nice in my experience. They brought me my daytime medicine right around 9am and my nighttime medicine around 8pm. Every morning and night your nurse would come to you and ask you questions like how your day was, to rate your anxiety and depression on a scale of 1-10, and so forth. 

Your doctor would come around every morning as well to discuss outpatient plans with you to get you set up for when you leave the hospital, as well as discuss or change your medications. My doctor ended up changing my Lexapro for Prozac, upping my dosage of Lamictal, and adding Remoron to the mix. 

Alongside the doctor, I also saw a psychologist who gave me a thorough evaluation. He let me sit down and talk to him about my life leading up to how I got to the psych ward, and he filled up 3 pages full of notes. Afterwards, I took a 567 true/false quiz called the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) and the Rorschach Test. 

I was in the psych ward until today, March 3rd. Before I left, I had one last talk with my doctor, who gave me a briefing on the psychologist's report. It turns out, I have autism. Specifically, I have Asperger's, so that was a pretty big shock to me. 

I think the biggest thing I learned in my stay at the psych ward was that the other patients are just like you and me. They're completely normal people who just need some help. None of them were mean or psychopaths. They were all just average joes with bad anxiety, depression, and ADHD. I thoroughly enjoyed talking with and getting to know them.

brejjt,mentalhealth,1558466008.0,"My depression and anxiety had its up and downs ever since I first started working. It went downhill in March when despite having a great therapist and taking meds, I got very suicidal. I was on the edge of the subway platform. I felt like a failure.

&#x200B;

I've been on sick leave since then. I thought I had disappointed so many people in my life, but my therapist has helped me in forgiving myself and moving on little by little. I decided not to go back to my current teaching position for the next school year, which will cause financial instability, but I'm in such a better mentality. Being close with my mom, she has noticed that I smile and talk more, and that what she thought was ""normal stress"" was me barely managing my depression the past three years. I was desperate to ""fix myself,"" and to just ""suck it up because everyone has work stress.""

&#x200B;

I have so much respect for teachers. I am interviewing for other schools, but I will most likely do a mix of tutoring/sub work/reception. I am still sad that I couldn't push through another school year, but I am feeling happier that I don't have to go back. I have options. And maybe someday, I will go back to the classroom in the future. I'm working on hobbies I've completely abandoned when I was working. Teaching is a huge commitment. I have mixed feelings about my ideal work situation, but I'm glad I'm taking the time to reflect and slowly plan my next steps.

Vitamin D supplements are super cheap and you can even buy them on Amazon. Consider giving it a try. I noticed the change after only 3-4 days already.

But if you take any meds, check in with your doctor or at least Google to ensure it's safe for you to add the vitamin D supplements (there's like three meds that you'd have to be careful with, as far as I know). 

Additionally, if you're vegetarian/vegan or just don't eat a lot of meat, an iron deficiency could also be a reason for your depression. Iron supplements are also on Amazon for little money.

As this is getting a lot of traction: What this post was about is that my therapist as well as I thought that I had depression. But taking vitamin D solved many problems for me. A vitamin D deficiency can cause many of the symptoms depression does, up to the point of a misdiagnosis. That's why this post exists. Some people may be misdiagnosed, some people may not even have a therapist to diagnose them so they did it themselves and rolled with it. 

This post is a suggestion to consider the possibility and try something new, to raise awareness that something that looks and feels like depression doesn't have to be exactly that.

gb6kuf,mentalhealth,1588288197.0,"TLDR at the bottom. 


Growing up, my mood was unpredictable. It was a constant state of anger, immaturity, anxiety, and fear. My parents gave me stuff I wanted but were pretty ignorant when it came to my mental health issues. They thought I would outgrow my behaviors or treat me the same way they treated my brothers. Thinking about it now, numerous reg flags were there. I was very defiant and scared of a lot of things. Many of them irrational. I remember being in like junior high and my mother telling me to get something from the car while we were at a family friends party. It was dark already and I took one look outside, saw the car parked across the street and got scared. Idk of what but my mind told me to be scared. I asked my friend to come with me but she didn‚Äôt want to and I think she was scared too because it was dark. I go back to my mom who is talking to her friends and tell her I‚Äôm scared and ‚Äú(friend) doesn‚Äôt want to go with me.  I don‚Äôt want to go to the car‚Äù (friends mom was in the circle of friends like 10 of them and I was hoping she would make her go with me (I know subtle tattletale, in junior high too...currently cringing)) and my mom ended up going with me to the car. I didn‚Äôt think much of this but the next day my dad told me that one of the parents called me a spoiled brat as soon as I left with my mom to the car. Looking back I should have told my mom personally but I didn‚Äôt think it would matter since the people we were surrounded by were childhood friends who knew me at a young age. 

Growing up in my house was overall not good emotionally. Lots of instability with my father‚Äôs moods and sometimes my mother‚Äôs. I ended up being a rude child and would get angrily reprimanded by my parents (sometimes physically even if it didn‚Äôt hurt...it still did...if that makes sense). I remember saying goodbye to my parents friends (at their friends house) by just waving the off in an ‚Äúeh‚Äù manner (I tried to be cute and joke with them...also I was half tired) my parents pushed me to hug them and kiss them (cultural thing) but I was just like ‚Äúmeh‚Äù and didn‚Äôt. I didn‚Äôt realize I was embarrassing my parents and their friends. I came off as rude. I was like 12 or 13 at the time. As soon as we got into the car my dad exploded in anger and shouted at me to never do that again. He said this while also putting his fist to my knee banging on my knee every time I didn‚Äôt give a coherent ‚Äúyes‚Äù to him when he told me to never act that way again. I was in tears. I really didn‚Äôt think anything of my actions. Looking back, yeah it is rude of me but I don‚Äôt think they was the correct parental way to go about things. 

There were many instances like this. Where I would come off rude and anxious especially when I didn‚Äôt get my way with things. Forcing my friends to play with me when they didn‚Äôt want to. Telling on them to their older siblings hoping they would make their sibling play with me only to be told ‚Äúshe doesn‚Äôt want to play with you. That‚Äôs not my problem‚Äù, picking fights with my siblings, screaming and shouting loud enough that the neighbors can hear me... 

I was recently diagnosed with BPD, PTSD, and ADHD. In addition to my MDD, OCD, and GAD. I feel like a light just switched on this year and made me go ‚Äúoh wow I really wasn‚Äôt a normal kid‚Äù.

tldr: to a lot of people growing up I came off as an annoying and rude immature brat but after analyzing a lot of my behaviors and my upbringing as an adult, I now realize it was possibly a mixture of poor parenting and undiagnosed mental health issues.",https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/gb6kuf/was_anyone_else_called_a_spoiled_brat_growing_up/,Was anyone else called a spoiled brat growing up (or anything close to that) but now realize it was a mixture of poor parenting and undiagnosed mental health issues?,,414,41,0.98

I am very prone to spiralling, or snowballing, when something bad happens to me. 

Recently, I've been getting into arguments with my mum and it's been making me feel like shit. She tells me I'm brainwashed, makes me feel stupid, and a lot more. When I brought it up to her she denied the lot and the only apology I got was a 'sorry you feel that way' 

This isn't something small, I don't think, but i also feel as though I'm overreacting, but that just makes me feel worse, and so the spiral begins.

And it always ends with a 'you should just kill yourself'. Almost always followed with a 'no you retard thats a bad idea' 

Because other than little things like that, my life is fine. I have friends, a loving partner (long distance atm), a roof over my head and hot meals. I'm fine. Yet I'm not. And, again, it makes me feel worse that there are people who have it so, so badly, and yet I have the audacity to feel the way I do?

I do not want to bring any of this up to my mother. She would just gaslight me again. My partner knows, though, and is as supportive as he can be in the current situation. That's all I can ask for, right?

I could not accept my own illness. On the day I realized I had it, it was a total breakdown being unable to accept the reality.  I found out about my own illness when I went online to find out what my medication is for. I thought it was PTSD at first. 

I felt like a fool. They said it was too hard to tell me the truth because I was so young at that time. They could not accept that I had Schizophrenia at age 12.

iuoul7,therapy,1600365830.0,"Maybe I am bitter. Maybe it‚Äôs the specific people in my life. I decided to finally start therapy recently after many years of contemplating. Many years of rough times mentally. Really rough. Once I told my family and close friends, I got 70-80% terrible reactions. I realized I haven‚Äôt let many people in on my real pain, especially in the last few years. I also realized that, because of that, my family thinks I am 100% doing good! Haha. I stopped asking for help because no one seemed to care/ want to help. But anyways. 
Some things that were said to me when I mentioned I‚Äôm starting therapy: 
1. Being more spiritual is the cure to mental health. 
2. Take more vitamin B
3. Read self help books
4. Most therapists are terrible
5. They‚Äôll probably misdiagnose you
6. They just want you to get hooked on anti-depressants, big pharma!
7. Take cold showers (??) 
8. Your grandma only tried to commit suicide multiple times because it was hell living with your grandpa. 
Even if some of these things are true, even though I know they‚Äôre just trying to help, I‚Äôd have much more appreciated a quick ‚Äúgood for you, I hope it goes well.‚Äù Instead of each person trying to dive so deep into what my ‚Äúproblem‚Äù is and trying to help me fix it. That‚Äôs why I am going to a therapist, because I have tried many things on my own and am still having issues that I think a professional should be helping me with, that‚Äôs all! I am doing this preemptively in a way because I have been in darker places in my life, and feel this is a good idea to get on top of my mental health before it‚Äôs too late. 
Needless to say, I feel much more stigmatized since letting the people closest to me in my life know what I‚Äôm doing and no longer want to reach out to any of them about anything like that.

I haven't shaved in months and if you're grossed out by that, stop reading now. 

I haven't shaved anywhere. Legs, armpits, pubic area. It just seemed too overwhelming. My boyfriend doesn't mind, so my sex life didn't really get worse because of that and I live in a colder climate, so wearing long pants during the summer was completely normal.

To be honest, I kinda liked how things were. Less waste, more time, less skin irritation and stuff. But I knew it didn't come from my worldview, but from my depression. Shaving is the least important, as I could go days without eating, without brushing my teeth and showering. 

So before I go on: shaving isn't necessary, showering is. So if you're a male, female, whatever, just don't shave if you don't want to. It's not a part of hygiene. You won't ""sweat more"" because of some hair. But take a shower from time to time. Not a full-on spa singing one hour shower, but get in there for a few minutes. Even if it'll be just standing under pouring water. 

But if you want to - just like I did - go for it. I shaved my whole body today, I used some coconut oil on my legs and scented oil under my armpits (zero-waste deodorant!). Apart from that, I also did a full on skin care routine and brushed my teeth AND flossed. Wow.
I'm sure most people do it regularly and it grosses them out when they have a single piece of salad between their teeth after a meal. But for me, it was a huge milestone. I hope to do it again tomorrow, without forcing myself. I haven't felt this fresh and sexey in quite some time.

bh9h95,mentalhealth,1556203566.0,"My sentiments are based on being subscribed to the sub and seeing a pattern in which posts make it into my feed. This is not an attack on the sub, it's a suggestion to represent all the colors of the rainbow here.

This sub seems to mostly pay attention and support people whose mental illness makes it difficult for them to perform basic functions, like getting out of bed. I understand that life with mental illness is like a 10k race. For those struggling with the basics, every day moving a yard feels like a war against yourself, but what about those of us who are sprinting? 

I leave my house daily for work, social gatherings etc but I face many difficulties each day stemming from mental illness. I come here and I make posts about it. Hoping to find someone who feels the same. Who lives that struggle. Just one person who relates and reaches out and says yeah I'm drowning in my own thoughts too. Or hey I used to struggle with that here's what helped me. 

But I get nothing. And I see no posts on my feed from others who live a similar struggle. I'm sure they're out there, but their posts get buried or if they're anything like me, they delete them later because if no one feels the same, what's the point. All the support goes to the ones who seem to be struggling the most outwardly.

It reminds me of when I was a kid, and I had a troubled sister. I went to school, had poems put in the newspaper, great grades and had a few short stories published in books, but no one in my home paid any mind. When I left for college I asked my mother why she left me to my own devices so often. Why she didn't put so much effort into me like with my sister. She replied; ""because you've always done so well on your own, I didn't think you need me."" That has stuck with me even to this day,and that's how I feel about this sub.

I assume it was super amusing making fun of me based on the giggles and laughs from your group behind me as I used the self check out for the few things I was buying. Since you lot are obviously comedic geniuses I thought I'd share your wittisms.

""Omg why would she ever leave her house in shorts?!"" Said by the pretty blonde girl whose shirt I internally admired earlier. 

You were pretty spot on since I'd hadn't worn shorts outside my home in almost 2 years. I had finally found a pair that fit well and were long enough so I thought they looked ok. Thank you for disabusing me of that notion.

""She probably doesn't leave the house often anyway. Maybe she's afraid she won't fit through the door one of these days."" Said from who I assume was blondie's boyfriend. 

Well, you were wrong about the door thing, that's a full on exaggeration because even I know I'm not that big. However you were right about me not leaving the house often but it has nothing to do with weight. It's because I'm still severely depressed over the unexpected passing of my fianc√© less than 2 years ago.

""Look she's buying spinach! I guarantee it's not for her!"" This was from the brunette with blue highlights. 

Sorry to disappoint but it's totally for me.

""Why doesn't she just get that weight loss surgery? She would obviously qualify."" From a different brunette. 

Well actually honey, I already had it when I was 17 and barely qualified. This was in the very early days of bariatric surgery and I obviously didn't have ideal results. What's even worse though is it's left me with multiple, life long health issues and chronic pain. I've had to have several additional surgeries to try and correct things, with little success. A lot of those health issues mean medication and many of those medications have weight gain as a side effect. I also have Hypothyroidism and Polycystic Ovary Syndrome which both can cause weight gain. As can depression, which I mentioned earlier.

""I'd kill myself if I ever got that big."" Said by blondie. 

I guess it's A: good you're not because no matter how horrible your comments I would never wish for you to feel like you needed to die and B: I guess I'm mentally stronger than you. That's probably because of all the shit I've been through but believe me there are often days when I think I'd be better off dead. And I'd be lying if I didn't say how hard it was after hearing your comments to just make it to my car before I broke down crying. 

I don't know why you all felt the need to be so cruel but I hope eventually you learn to have a little more empathy. You don't know me or my story, but you judged me based solely on my weight and found me lacking. Therefore I was worthy of your scorn. 

Your comments hurt, and I imagine they will stick with me for awhile, but they won't break me. However, someday, if you continue this act you might end up being the last straw that does break someone. I hope you never have to realize that your comments pushed a person to end their life and I also hope you never have to feel the way you made me feel today.

That's what broke me. I never cry but that was the first time in months where I cried for real. It was like something hit me. We aren't extremely close but she unknowingly got me through the hardest time in my life. I owe her everything. 
That was when I decided I will not die. Ever. No matter how unappealing the concept of living became.

It's been a month. 

A teacher at my high school helped me realize what I achieved and that I should be proud of myself. I'm not a native English speaker but I taught myself English in 3 years and by the time I was 15 I was at level C1. She showed me that it's OK to be proud of the things I did. And for the first time, I believed her.
After starting my antidepressants everything slowly got clearer and brighter. 
I even got a friend at school! An actual friend that wants to talk to me! She sometimes laughs at the fact that I say ""thank you"" every time she agrees to go somewhere with me but I'm just so happy and surprised that I'm talking to people.
I never thought I could be this happy. I feel like I'm 12 again, happy with friends, going out. I never thought it was possible to get out of the lowest of the lows.

k1ncvz,mentalhealth,1606424634.0," There  is power in standing up for yourself and sticking to your personal  boundaries regarding how you participate in life as a trauma survivor. I  hate the constant barrage of showing up because of obligation. Fuck  that. I mean, when I think about the fact that people will shame you  over not doing something that you don‚Äôt want to do, I get irate. I think  about how many times in our lives that we are put in the position of  showing up due to social constructs, and I want to smash my face into  the wall. **You don‚Äôt owe anyone your time or sanity.**

I  implore you to please take care of yourself over the next few weeks  starting today. The number one thing that people healing trauma can do  is to say no or to say nothing at all. You don‚Äôt have to go to family  gatherings and events where past abusers are present. You don‚Äôt have to  go to work get-togethers because you are in recovery, and Tom can‚Äôt have  just one drink. You don‚Äôt have to go to the hundreds of things you are  invited to. Why? Because you are a goddamn adult, and you have the  choice here. No one is going to force you into a car, to put the key in  the ignition, drop the gear to D, and hit the road. If I‚Äôm wrong about  that, we have much more severe problems on our hands.

Creating agency as a trauma survivor

Look,  here is the deal. We are used to putting our needs secondary as CPTSD  survivors. At some point, our needs got put on the back burner as a  survival mechanism. That is OK. We can acknowledge that. However, as we  move forward, we must follow our gut instinct and listen to what our  soul tells us. If everything in you is screaming, **don‚Äôt go,** then don‚Äôt go. And don‚Äôt tell me that it‚Äôs easy said than done because you are in control. Y-O-U.

You  have the power here, and look, I know that is scary, but it‚Äôs true. You  can step into your personal boundaries, and your right as a human being  is that you only have to do what you want to do. I trust that the truth  of our healing journey recognizes that we are allowed to have agency in  our lives.

I challenge you to  continue to double-down on your personal boundaries and your right to  say no. Hell, start today. No law states you must suffer through another  family thanksgiving with your narcissistic mother, verbally abusive  step-father, racist grandmother, or anyone in between. Today, if you  need to say no, please say no. Order Pad Thai; it‚Äôs better than turkey  anyway.

Until next time my friend‚Ä¶

lpayuh,mentalhealth,1613954556.0,"I know I sound like a wimp, but keep reading.

I am an mental health tech, and my job is to basically be a glorified babysitter for special needs kids. I'm good at my job, but something last night makes me start shaking when I think about it. 

One of my clients scares me. I don't know her exact problem, but her father told me that her mother had done dope and drank alcohol when she was pregnant with her. 

This girl was throwing a tantrum after we left a pet store. She insisted that she held cats (which we couldn't because covid.) First she whined, then she cried, then she snapped. I had to call her mother, and we stayed on the phone with her to get her to leave the pet store, literally one step at a time. 

When we got to the car, she began *screaming* at the top of her lungs that she wanted my tablet to play games on. I wouldn't let her, because she already threatened to break it. This lasted for twenty minutes. I drove with her, another client, and my shadower(new hire in training), to the highway. The girl suddenly stopped screaming, unbuckled herself, and got up next to me while I was driving 70mph. She leaned against me, and told me that I was ugly, had no friends, deserved to die, and would kill me if I let her. She began reaching for the wheel all slowly and dramatically like she was going to yank it into the oncoming traffic from my left side. The shadower yanked her back, but she kept lunging for the wheel, trying to make us crash into the other cars. I eventually pulled over on the side of the highway and called her mom. The girl then opened the car door and tried to run out into the field, saying that she was going to get us in trouble for losing her. We dragged her back into the car, and put on the child lock. She didn't like that, and tried to fight us once we got settled again. When her mom finally came, she started acting all nice, denying everything that happened. She took the child home, and we took the other client home.

I forgive this girl, because she has a mental illness and couldn't control herself. Yet, I can't stop shaking, and I couldn't sleep that night because I kept dreaming about deadly car crashes. Car crashes are one of my biggest fears, I cant help but feel terrified when I even think about getting in one. I get genuinely scared when I picture her in my mind, and deep down I want her dead. 

I will have to see her again, only time I will be prepared. How do I get over this fear that causes me to black out, start trembling, and cant form words correctly?

k7cgm5,mentalhealth,1607191990.0,"Compassion is something we find easy when we think of someone we love. But what about someone you find annoying or don‚Äôt like? If you think about someone you‚Äôve met who wasn‚Äôt very nice to you, or someone that was rude or did something you didn‚Äôt agree with, you might ask the question why would you feel compassion for someone who behaves this way. 

The importance of compassion isn‚Äôt only to relieve suffering and make the world a better place, it‚Äôs to free yourself from your own suffering - your sadness, your anxiety and particularly your anger. When you see the suffering of others in their behaviour it helps to reduce your own resentments.

But where we can really struggle is feeling compassion towards ourselves; when we‚Äôre suffering we sometimes punish ourselves more for not being good enough. Compassion begins with yourself - when you let go of the idea of who you think you need to be and accept yourself as you are it‚Äôs an act of kindness that allows you to start to let go of suffering.

e44yen,mentalhealth,1575154056.0,"I'm 29. At age 13 I was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder and about six months ago I was diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder. I also get anxiety attacks sporadically but never been diagnosed with anxiety to my knowledge. The first time I had mental health problems I was four or five years old. I got put into a psychiatric hospital for a week when I was five (don't want to get too much into why I was put in but basically I had extreme trouble regulating my emotions), and it was at that point that I internalized the thought (or message I thought I was getting) that I was bad and wrong and messed up. A year later my mom died from cancer and I thought I had made her sick because I stressed her out too much from being ""bad"". So again my vision of myself as a bad person was heavily internalized and confirmed. Then I went through bullying and teasing at school from age 8 to 12 because I was fat (from comfort eating because of losing my mom) and awkward and every demeaning thing the bullies said just confirmed my belief in myself being a disgusting ugly embarrassing pathetic piece of trash. Around age 10 was the first time I wanted to die. Age 13 I was hospitalized again for being suicidal. I've been on about 10-12 various medications (at different times) since I was 13 trying to treat my mental health. I have done probably 10 years of weekly therapy appointments. And despite all that nothing helped me 100% or even 50%. I still was depressed and anxious, I developed an eating disorder that went in and out of my life for 10 years, I still hated myself and had very low self-esteem and self-injured and felt suicidal and just...dark.

At 29 I still feel like I'm just destined to be this way. My biological father died from alcoholism after having it for about 35 years and he also had been diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder recently before he died. My mother's side of the family had depression and anxiety and food addiction. I just feel like I'm destined to be and stay mentally ill. And I feel like it's part of my identity. Ever since my mom died I've gone through life feeling isolated and different from everyone else around me. I feel I'm just a broken person and I've felt it so long I really internalized it at a very early age. I know it sounds ridiculous but since the dark, self-hating, self-sabotaging thoughts are all I have known for practically all my life, they are.... comforting to me in a strange way. It feels.... right? to just wrap myself up in a blanket of sadness and turn my back on the world. I can't see myself being any other way. I feel like it's formed my personality? I'm not really sure. I just... at this point in my life I can see how not fixing my depression and other issues will leave my life in ruins and possibly end with me dead by suicide or reckless behavior, or long-term hospitalized. Obviously neither of those I would like, but another part of me feels indifferent to that happening. Like, ""...meh, you're a piece of shit and so messed up anyways, you're just another human out of the billions of others contributing to the demise of this planet so it really wouldn't be a big deal and would be better in the long run.""

I'll end here before I continue rambling on. Basically, I feel like being mentally ill is embedded into my DNA and is in every part of me and I can't find the motivation to try to change it or even the belief that I deserve that change or that it will even ever happen. Additionally I feel like I have no idea who I would be without it. Has anyone felt this?

Now, I‚Äôm traveling Europe alone for the first time. I‚Äôm doing what I want when I want, meeting new people, seeing things I never thought I‚Äôd see, and loving every minute of it. Every second I think about the fact that I could have not had this opportunity. I could have cut my life short and never been to Europe, never felt the freedom of standing at the top of a waterfall in Iceland or on the River Thames in London. 

I‚Äôm so thankful that I made the call before it was too late, and that I had people in my corner when I woke up in the emergency room that cold March morning. I‚Äôm glad that I chose life, despite how hard it can be, how cloudy and dark and hopeless it is at times. I‚Äôm glad that I sought help and got the help that I needed.

I think we need to change the name of anxiety and also depression so that they sound as serious as they are. So many people just completely brush off these serious mental health issues because they are so common. Thinking that ‚Äòfeeling depressed‚Äô or a bit ‚Äòanxious‚Äô is the same as a full blown mental illness. Telling someone you have depression or anxiety feels like it has the same impact, as telling someone you have a cold. 
It needs to be talked about in a more serious manner so that people suffering from these sometimes life ruining mental illnesses don‚Äôt have to be ashamed. 
Pretty much every person i have spoke to who has or did have clinal depression (including myself) say that they often feel guilty, they have thoughts similar too ‚Äúother people have it so much worse than me‚Äù or ‚Äúim just over exaggerating.‚Äù This is not how things should be. People shouldn‚Äôt have to feel bad for being in pain. Think about it this way, you dont see a guy with a broken leg feeling guilty about having broke his leg. No, he goes to the doctors, gets help, lets it heal and will likely receive get well soon letters from family or friends. Why does the same not happen with a broken mind?
If everyone in a community can realise how serious anxiety and depression actually is, then they can empathise with those who suffer, helping MILLIONS of people who‚Äôs lives are a constant struggle, to at least feel a little bit more understood, accepted by their peers and less guilty. That to me, would be a massive step in the right direction ‚ù§Ô∏è

hrmfqc,mentalhealth,1594815208.0,"To avoid getting into the details, I have to build a thick wall around myself because I have been struggling with multiple mental health issues for pretty much all my life.

But slowly and surely, I have been gathering strategies, techniques and other methods on how to deal with them, even though the amount of effort and time that it took me was way longer than I waited for them to be and I still have a lot stuff to delve into in order to master these strategies.

Over the years, I have been learning how to break that thick wall that I built over the years and slowly creep into the dark unknown and face these demons and even face the real world due to that my experiences has left me with a scared and scarred image of the world.

But for some reason, dealing with loneliness is perhaps one of the most exhausting, nerve-wrecking and humiliating war that I had to fight through.

I am well aware that loneliness is not easy to deal with - it is a mentally tricky thing to face and counter and can lead to so many other traps and other complications and difficulties that you sometimes become stuck in a maze or a in a super-thick and sticky web of different threads with different poisons slowly sucking away what is left of your blood, soul and health.

It is a double-edged sword that you want to get out of this invisible prison but at the same time, the prison is also your only ""home"" and walking out of it is very scary and the fear of being rejected, even if you try to be as friendly as possible, is very tough to overcome.

&#x200B;

The person few years, I had to really pull myself from my bootstraps to overcome the traps of loneliness - the fear of being rejected, the neediness of attention and the appropriate social skills for different situations.

Yet for some reason, as much as the world of today *should* be able to allow me to use the resources that we use today like social media to my advantage to reach out but in reality, it is often the opposite!!

&#x200B;

I know that social media is a big joke and a trap of itself where behind every smile and photo of the last party, dinner or get away that you want to hides a dark thing that you do not want to share to the rest of the world.

Yet at the same time, seeing the sheer amount of photos and posts where I see smiles and even laughs with other people, friends or even random strangers, it makes me feel angry and pathetic with myself, desperate to do something about it.

I reached out plenty of times with other people but more often than not, communication in the 21st Century makes us more alien than connecting to one another.

It is super easy to ghost someone nowadays or leave a seen without even giving a clear reason why or giving the cold shoulder because the person you are talking to is simply a stranger or you do not like for no reason whatsoever. I constantly feel that I do not know where I am with another person. It is humiliating and nerve-wracking and it burns me out. It makes me feel pitiful, petty, little. It makes me feel less of a human being and like I am being passively-aggressively bullied.

&#x200B;

Yet it is also pretty hilarious that the technology of today is supposed to make us more connected yet it makes it too easy to push people away. 

Why is it common to leave only seen almost after every message? Why not just speak from the heart? Or just say a word? Anything

I feel humiliated and angry and constantly going through a thick and mighty storm every day to keep myself sane throughout this process and it feels like I am going around in circles or walking inside a maze where I have no idea where I am going.

I know that loneliness is also in my head (even though my mind and body have real reactions to the feeling) but this feeling is incredibly overwhelming and when I try to reach out, nobody is available or I have to be very careful of what to say to others as though I am walking on eggshells because of random excuses like being busy or unavailable and/or whatever excuse they can think of to avoid contact",https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/hrmfqc/being_lonely_in_the_21st_century_where_we_are/,"Being lonely in the 21st Century where we are living in a super-connected world is fricking hard, mentally taxing and it burns me out",,383,14,1.0

pfa5s6,mentalhealth,1630429717.0,"Disclaimer: this isn‚Äôt targeted at any one individual or group, but rather a school of thought that seems to have penetrated everyday discourse surrounding mental health. If I say ‚Äúyou‚Äù or ‚Äúyou people‚Äù, I‚Äôm referring to people who subscribe to the bullshit thinking I‚Äôm about to outline. This was meant to be posted to r/unpopularopinion but got deleted, so I figured y‚Äôall could appreciate my sentiment instead.

It seems like whenever I see a post about mental health (outside of subs that are directly related to the concept), the same point comes up.

*‚ÄùDuH‚Ä¶ like 90% of people who say they have depression are just faking it for attention! All those kids on TikTok just want to LARP as Billie Eilish and pretend they have a mental illness so they can be trendy!!‚Äù*

Just, stop. And I say this as someone with *diagnosed* depression, anxiety and ADHD. Here‚Äôs why this way of thinking is complete and utter **horse shit**.

First off, depression/anxiety are *incredibly* common, and exist on a wide spectrum of severity. When people see someone who claims they‚Äôre depressed, but still manages to go to work/school without many problems, they automatically jump to the thought of ‚Äúoh well they seem to be doing pretty well. they‚Äôre not *really* depressed.‚Äù

This is such bullshit because unless you‚Äôve advanced science by 5 decades and figured out how to read someone else‚Äôs thoughts, you don‚Äôt know what the fuck they‚Äôre going through. Even if that ‚Äúnormal‚Äù person seems functional, there‚Äôs no telling what‚Äôs going on in their head. 

You think everyone who has ‚Äúreal‚Äù depression is a lifeless sack of garbage who sits in bed crying all day? Guess what, there‚Äôs probably a handful of people at your job/in your class that have ‚Äúreal‚Äù depression. They just hide it well because that‚Äôs what people with mental health issues *have to do* in order to succeed.

Second, on the flip side of the coin, *so many* people assume the complete opposite. ‚ÄúThis person has depression and ADHD, but doesn‚Äôt take care of themselves and can‚Äôt hold down a job without breaking down? God, another faker, huh? That‚Äôs not mental illness, that‚Äôs *laziness*‚Äù.

Like, *what the fuck is wrong with you???* That‚Äôs literally what severe mental illness does to you? If ‚Äúdepression‚Äù can‚Äôt exist if you‚Äôre doing well on the surface, and it *also* can‚Äôt exist if you‚Äôre doing terribly on the surface, then what the hell do you think depression is!?

But even putting aside the obvious lack of understanding regarding mental health, it‚Äôs *still* fucked up to call someone out as a ‚Äúfaker‚Äù.

Look at it this way, let‚Äôs say someone actually *is* faking it. They post on social media claiming they have depression, but they actually don‚Äôt.

*WHO FUCKING CARES?*

Even if they don‚Äôt have a diagnosed mental illness, they clearly aren‚Äôt getting the attention they need outside of social media. And since when is asking for attention a bad thing? Most of the people who receive these complaints are *literally children.* You think that if a fucking *child* is resorting to random strangers online for support, there‚Äôs absolutely *nothing* wrong with them? And they *don‚Äôt* need people to hear them out? Of fucking course not!!

And here‚Äôs the biggest problem. WHO ARE WE TO DECIDE WHETHER SOMEONE IS FAKING OR NOT?

Mental illness transcends class, race and gender. Nobody is immune from chronic depression/anxiety. 99% of the time you *cannot fucking tell* if someone has a mental illness or not. Because it‚Äôs a **M E N T A L** illness. 

So why take the chance on saying ‚Äúoh they‚Äôre just lying for attention‚Äù, when there‚Äôs a strong possibility that they‚Äôre serious and you‚Äôre just making it worse by making them feel like an impostor?

Seriously, what does anyone stand to gain from calling someone out for ‚Äúfaking it‚Äù? 

‚ÄúOh, but the more people who fake it, the more stigma there will be against people who have *actual* mental illness.‚Äù

Bull. Shit. Where do you think that stigma is coming from? Because it sure as fuck isn‚Äôt coming from people who actually care about mental health.

It‚Äôs coming from people like you, who refuse to believe that mental illness can affect *everyone*. No mental health professional, or doctor, or caring person is shutting these people down. It‚Äôs just people like you. The resources to treat mental health are always available, but people who need them aren‚Äôt getting them because they‚Äôre constantly told that they‚Äôre making it worse for people who have ‚Äúreal‚Äù mental illness.

And one more thing.

‚ÄúOh you probably self-diagnosed, didn‚Äôt you? That means your mental illness isn‚Äôt real.‚Äù

Oh, fuuuuuuck off.

First of all, how do you think you get a diagnosis in the first place? You think a doctor is gonna come to your house, take one look at you and say ‚Äúyep, you‚Äôve got depression‚Äù. That‚Äôs not how it works! You get a diagnosis by recognizing symptoms within yourself, condensing them and narrowing it down to a few possibilities, then bringing that info to a professional when/if you can. This process is known as, you guessed it, **self-diagnosis**.

And what about people who *can‚Äôt* get diagnosed? I‚Äôm lucky enough to live in a place where mental health is taken seriously and covered by insurance. So, I was able to be diagnosed and treated from a young age.

What about people who aren‚Äôt so lucky? In the US, you can pay up to $500 for an initial consultation. Not everyone can afford that. And in some countries, mental health treatment is a fucking joke.  It‚Äôs chocked up to weakness or insanity sometimes, so good luck getting a diagnosis in one of those places. And actually getting a prescription for meds? That‚Äôs a whole other mountain to climb, even in more progressive countries.

So if you‚Äôre in an area where getting a diagnosis is next to impossible, what are you supposed to do? Just sit there feeling miserable and telling no one because you ‚Äúmight be faking it‚Äù? Fuck no, you get online and do what you can to find support and raise awareness for others in your situation.

Bottom line, nobody knows what mental illnesses someone else is or isn‚Äôt dealing with. And even if you do, why the hell do you care?

b5ru3w,mentalhealth,1553617722.0,"Narcissistic personality disorder is a horrible, painful condition. It's a mental disorder that, just like any, ruins the lives of people who never wanted to be this way. Like other personality disorders it takes away someone's control over their own thoughts and behaviours and twists their perceptions of the world around them. They've quite often been through abuse which has led them to develop their condition, and often they aren't even able to see that there's anything wrong - just like in other psych conditions.

Sociopathy hasn't even been considered a real diagnosis for decades. The closest thing is antisocial personality disorder, which is another horrible condition that people are forced to live with. It damages someone's ability to empathise and feel positive emotions, their ability to control strong bursts of anger or sadness and to properly deal with their emotions, and it makes people struggle to control impulsive behaviour and fit in with society. Someone with ASPD isn't the stoic, emotionless killer from a horror film or the cool, charismatic, cunning CEO. In fact they're very often poor and not too clever, having grown up in toxic environments and never getting the support they need to develop properly.

Both of these conditions are extremely complex and very, very hard to identify and diagnose, even for an experienced psychiatrist sitting across from their patient.

Reddit uses these terms the way people used ""retarded"" a decade ago. People have taken crippling conditions that they know fuck all about beyond watching slasher films and Dr Phil, and turned them into slurs.

It's even worse just how readily people make these armchair diagnoses. Whenever anyone does something bad, they must be a *sociopath!* It couldn't just be that normal people like you and me sometimes do bad things for a variety of very complex reasons - no, they must be a sociopath (and that means monster!)

Whenever a /r/relationship_advice or /r/amitheasshole post describes someone doing something that could even just be interpreted as slightly unreasonable, or a slight overreaction, they're a TOXIC NARCISSIST! No, they didn't just snap because they've been under a lot of stress like any human can, they dont just seem unreasonable because we don't know what's going on in their head and know their side of the story. No, they're a NARCISSIST! And it seems *everyone* on Reddit knows at least one narcissist, usually more.


And how do you deal with someone who has a debilitating mental health condition? You cut them out of your life completely! After all, they're toxic and they'll ruin your life if you let them!

This happens with things that happened years ago or when I was a child, too. It's keeping me up at night, it makes me feel physically sick, it makes it hard to eat and makes me angry because I'm trying to get better, I'm trying to put myself out there and overcome my fears but as soon as I'm alone with my thoughts it backfires.

I've had chronic depression since I was 9
It started to build when I was 7 with my personal life
I'm a high functioning depression with a job, a mortgage, a wife, and many things on my plate
The feeling of wanting to die, the suicidal stigma is always in the back of my mind and I feel like it haunts me
I do dishes, laundry, chores, and I keep myself constantly busy until I'm burnt out everyday
It gives me an excuse to feel important, and I'm only useful if I'm used for tasks or chores
I don't find any joy in life anymore
No amount of rest will help me
I oversleep
In my day off I slept 24 hours and refused to eat with no appetite

Everyone is fine with me doing chores and running myself dry until I actually stop doing those things
I think I'm going to get a divorce soon because my partner can't handle my symptoms after 7 years of being together

Life really doesn't get better

I wish I could sit here and give some inspirational thought to help others

But mental health is only for the rich

I'd love to go to a mental health institution, but i don't want to lose my income or be thousands in debt

I want to carve time to work in myself

I have better help therapy and do an hourly visit once a week

It's still never enough

I'm on 75mg of Amitriptyline and 300mg of bupropion

I have klonapin for panic attacks

It's still never enough

So here's to you kid,

It doesn't get better
There is no white light
No one comes to save you
You just keep fighting for those you love until you can't fight anymore

I've had to make peace with the fact I'll never be happy and I'm only meant to serve
That my dreams and aspirations don't matter in the grand scheme of life and I'm doomed to existing

It's too expensive to die. Ten thousand for the average funeral.

I have life insurance, but you have to wait three years before they start covering for a possible suicide because by then you've paid your dues

I'm incredible tired
I don't see a way out

I'm posting here to vent, I know I'm not the only one who feels the hopeless despair

Know you're not alone.
But know you're on your own.
You can't count on anyone.
No family, no friends, no love

I've hit rock bottom and I've made a dent in my stay here
But there's only one way to go from here...

Up.

in the last time I'm again at a very low point of my life and deep depression. I noticed that my feelings get worse when I'm scrolling through instagram seeing the posts and ""lives"" of other people and friends. I know it's not always the whole reality they show there, it's only the best part they post often with big theatre to have a worthy post. That's life today. Still I feel so bad seeing other people being with other people together having fun which remembers me that I should do the same but I'm not able to have much joy due to my depression and social anxiety. Then I feel guilty and worthless.

Who else here has the same experiences? Did anyone of you quit or at least ignore instagram for a time and saw definite positive improvements in their mental health? I think I won't delete Instagram as it's something a bit important like WhatsApp. Well ok it's not even near as important as WhatsApp but I don't know I probably would miss some things as I already deleted snapchat years ago and people tell me oh you missed this and that I sent you. But that's no problem for me, WhatsApp & Instagram is enough of the always online always having to present the perfect life bullshit.

y6oruq,mentalhealth,1666045608.0,"So this is a long one. Going to try and keep it short, and be available to answer questions.

Two years ago, with nearly 20 years of mood swings, sadness, anger, substance abuse, and hyper sexual behaviors behind me, I decided it was time to get help. My wife of 8 years was asking for a divorce, and my life had become unmanageable.

I started seeing a psychologist through the VA. I‚Äôm an army veteran. She turned out to be a specialist in BPD and after some time was able to diagnose me. I had always suspected either BPD or Bipolar. 

We‚Äôve worked together for about 2 years and have made amazing progress. She leads a Dialectic Behavioral Therapy group that worked wonders for me. It was life changing. Emotional intelligence, mindfulness, interpersonal effectiveness, and distress tolerance are all part of my life now. I‚Äôm not perfect, and I‚Äôm always willing to put in the work, but life is better than ever before. I truly feel like my BPD is in recession. I also recently got sober, which helps a lot.

So this last February my wife and I separated. This is primarily due to my unstable moods, anger issues, substance abuse, and hyper sexuality. I moved into my own place and it took months to stabilize and get into a healthy and productive routine.

My last appointment with my therapist, I mentioned that I understood I was in a vulnerable situation and I was taking dating very cautiously. Being roughly 70 days sober, not completely over my ex, and prone to emotional dependency, I need to really consider my actions and emotions. I‚Äôm in a vulnerable place where I could relapse in a few different ways.

Well two days after that she texts me at 11:30 pm and starts flirting with me. She‚Äôs never texted me before and acknowledged how risky it was to do so.

She even mentioned the fact that I said I was vulnerable, and stated she felt vulnerable as well.

I at first told her I wasn‚Äôt available because I had gone on a date with a new girl and wanted to give that my full attention while I figured out where it was going. Also, I‚Äôm not attracted to this woman.

Another day goes by and I can‚Äôt fight the curiosity. I started texting her and just soaked up the attention what felt sexually deviant. Asking her about why she likes me. What she‚Äôs into. What she would do to me. What she wants me to do to her.

Here‚Äôs the thing. I have a history periods of being sexually involved with people who I‚Äôm not attracted to because I like the attention, I like being used, and I like things that feel taboo. I almost always end up feeling ashamed and disgusted by my behavior when this happens. And this woman, more than anyone knows all of that about me. 

Well two nights after she texted me for the first time, I went over to her place to give her what she wanted. She didn‚Äôt pressure me to, so we were both consenting, but it doesn‚Äôt feel good now. I almost immediately realized I wasn‚Äôt into what I was doing, but I stayed and kept doing things until I got her off. Then I left.

Looking back on it, it feels a little predatory. Here‚Äôs the person I‚Äôve been most honest with about my hyper sexual episodes and how they‚Äôve always made me feel bad. And I end up getting baited into just that. 

I‚Äôm not going to report her. At this point I should have better control over myself. But I‚Äôm disappointed in both of us.

I‚Äôve since asked her to refer me to a new therapist. She did so happily and respectfully, and the new one feels like a great fit. 

There ya go.

EDIT:

I want to thank everyone for the overwhelming response to this post. I have to admit, I was honestly struggling with whether or not I should feel bad about this situation. It‚Äôs pretty clear now that what she did was wrong. Had the cards not been so stacked in her favor, she‚Äôs definitely not someone I would‚Äôve been intimate with.

So here‚Äôs the update, and I‚Äôll say at the beginning that many people are going to be less than satisfied. I reached out to her and told her exactly how I feel about what happened, how it was manipulative and I‚Äôm left feeling used. She seemed to be apologetic and understanding as to why I felt that way. I say ‚Äúseemed‚Äù because to be brutally honest I don‚Äôt know if this is a one time fuck up, or a calculated cruel person just doing her thing. Of course when you get called out on doing something wrong, you say whatever it takes to deescalate the situation. So who the fuck knows. 

I want to preface this next part with my feelings of how to support people dealing with abuse, trauma, and the like. I think it‚Äôs important to make yourself available to listen, offer support, and support them in finding closure, however they deem necessary. I‚Äôve had friends who were assaulted and didn‚Äôt report it, and I tried to understand that it‚Äôs their closure to find, not mine.

She said I‚Äôd be well within my rights to report this, if I decided to do so. I‚Äôm not planning on reporting her. I‚Äôm not blaming myself for what happened, but again it‚Äôs not uncommon for me to get myself into situations I regret like this. I‚Äôve expressed how I feel about it, I‚Äôm choosing to believe that she is sorry and remorseful (choosing because again, I‚Äôll never really know) and I‚Äôm moving on. It‚Äôs not fair to be taken advantage of, but I also don‚Äôt feel like it‚Äôs fair for me to be the one who has to report this and take on that process. 

Go easy on me, but this is where I‚Äôm at with it. Who knows, I may end up feeling differently about it in the future. Hell even as I write this I‚Äôm thinking ‚Äúdid she ever care about my well being? She never contacting me outside of a meeting to check on me. Even after I‚Äôd cry in a meeting and tell her I don‚Äôt know what to do, and I couldn‚Äôt fix my life, I couldn‚Äôt control myself. She never texted.

9zfdlo,mentalhealth,1542903191.0,"Living with a mother who has a mental illness, caused me to have a lot of resentment and anger as a child. It has also caused me to have my own issues with anxiety and depression. 

My mom had her own business and was very successful. When I was 8 we had a flood in our house that completely destroyed her business. I didn‚Äôt know it at the time, but she started doing heavy drugs. She would constantly pass out and not eat for days. 

At 8, I was no longer a child but a parent. I remember going into our kitchen to cook food so she would eat and seeing pipes and burnt spoons on the counter. As a teenager she would trick me into thinking that we could practice driving so I could get my license. When in reality, she would be flagging people down the street asking if they had any drugs she could buy. Few years later, she was put in a psychiatric hospital. She had called the police telling them to stop following her and bugging her house. She was arrested and placed in a psychiatric facility and diagnosed with schizophrenia. She was later court ordered to stay in a half way house. After her time was up, she decided that she never needed help and was able to walk out freely without anyone stopping her. 

Anosognosia has serious consequences. I‚Äôve watched my family members step away from her like the plague because they became so angry with her that she wouldn‚Äôt admit that she needed help or believed that she was doing it on purpose for attention. They convinced themselves that she would somehow ‚Äúsnap out of it.‚Äù 

Here‚Äôs my main point in all of this, if a person does not think that they need help they will NOT get treatment. In coping with my own mental issues, forcing anyone to do something they hate is far worse for our mental health. Instead of fighting it, accept it for what it is  Stop putting these expectations on us that are unrealistic. Sometimes we don‚Äôt need help in the way you think is best.

jegd7z,mentalhealth,1603159811.0," I have a 2 year long relationship with someone diagnosed with Schizoaffective disorder. Things have been very hard in the past, but right now, I feel really happy on my relationship and I do envision a long term future with this person. I don't exactly know why I am writing this, but since I feel like sharing a little of my story with the world, I thought it might be useful to someone to read my statement about my experience and journey to where I am now.

Things were really hard in the beginning. My partner was very unstable and deeply depressed, simple things like sleeping or eating were herculean tasks to him that demanded a lot. Huge anxiety was easily triggered, that led to paranoid and intrusive thoughts, specially at night. Sometimes it lasted a couple of days, sometimes it lasted weeks, or a month. I really felt like on the more ""happy"" and stable days I had to take the best advantage out of it so that he felt like ""coming back"" from the pit hole was worth it. I felt like every time we cycled back into a depressive episode he was further and further away from me. I knew I couldn't really do much more than support him and maintain the bare minimum communication he allowed me to have with him but I just kept insisting and insisting because I thought that if I stopped doing so he would just detach completely from everything and everyone.

It was rough. Sometimes the emotional distance between us was so big that I thought I was in love with a man that would never love me. I felt neglected emotionally a lot of the times because I was supporting everything I could but I couldn't really have that back because my partner was living in a ""survival"" mode. When he became more willing to share, our communication also improved, he shared more with me and I learned how to help him better and also how to help myself to not take things too personally sometimes. Also, therapy and medical treatment were of main importance for his progress of course. There's no partner that can cure an illness, it can make it less difficult, for sure, but only the right treatment can really make it better. Fast forward to nowadays my partner works a full time job with quite some responsibility, he has plans for the future with me, he's stable, for the most part, he keeps his medical and therapy appointments on check, and he's happy. I wouldn't be with anyone else but him. I'm more confident than I have ever been, for the first time I feel someone truly sees me. and values me. We're both on our early 20s and starting our careers, I hope we can move in together in the near future, of course there are still bad times, but I do think we are more prepared now to manage the hard times.

I love him deeply, I'm so so proud of him for overcoming so much and that he's no longer suicidal. I am beyond happy he hang on long enough to embrace the person he's becoming and let himself love and be loved too. There's no better feeling in the world than just laying on his chest listening to his heart beating at night before falling asleep, I now it sounds very cheesy, but it's really the truth for me, it does feel like heaven.

If you're on a relationship going with a hard time understanding and dealing with your partner's mental health, I don't mean with this that you should stay and that you should endure all of it because I know how brutal and lonely it can be. Mental illness is devastating for the ones suffering with it, but also to others close to them. On a relationship, it can indeed became unhealthy for both parts to stay together, so, by no means I believe that the answer is always to stay.

Couldn't find a place to actually hang from so it was more like intentional strangulation because I was just kind of sitting on the floor of the closet with my back against the door.  I really thought I was going to go through with it. Things got all blurry, but my heart started racing. I honestly felt more at peace in that moment than I have in years. Then my cat started scratching at the door behind me. The closer I felt myself to passing out, the more she started scratching. Listening to her frantic scratching is not what I wanted to hear in my last moments. And it kept reminding me that there was something that cared about me. It made me feel so guilty and horrible. Just added to the bullshit. But I love my cat and my husband and my friends but I am so tired. My job has sucked the life out of me for the last 4 years and I can't take the stress anymore. I feel like they'd be happier not having to worry about me anymore. Its almost like I'm mad at these people (and cat) for caring so much about me. It makes this process take so much more thought and deliberation. All of which I thought I had done beforehand this time. I want to cry for help but I can't because it makes me feel like even more of a burden. I'm only 26 why the hell am I like this. Im so mad.

We came to the conclusion together, that I am fed up of being judged, and wanna change that and the hypocracy in my family. I just don't know how.

Around March I had gotten back from a class trip which I had made some friends, opened up to people, and had a great going social life, something I always struggle with. But as you know what happened in March had some different plans.

My school was closed off, the only way I had contact to these people, I had a couple friends numbers, but didn‚Äôt really see them and drifted a bit apart.

I was plunged back into a state of loneliness I felt like I had no one, I still had peoples contact info, but being autistic means I extremely struggle with reaching out. This caused me to spiral

Thoughts of un worth, fear, and trapped filled me. I was a shell.

It came to a head when after long suffering I thought, this needs to end. I walked out of my room wondering the quickest, and painless way to end it.

I looked over and saw something, my German shepherd chilling on his bean bag. I curled up on the bag and vented, cried, and he just listened.

In the end, I left the beanbag feeling as though I am worthy of life. I had already tied a noose, I had access to knives, but little drago was there.

He had no idea, he didn‚Äôt pull me out of a fire, he didn‚Äôt fight off a bear, but by just being there he saved me.

It‚Äôs been over half a year now, I‚Äôve learned to talk more. I‚Äôve even for the first time in a long time, invited someone out. Im now indulging in my love of bikes and engineering. I‚Äôve healed, I‚Äôm now even starting to accept my neurodiversity and masking less.

I was feeling like shit today, borderline suicidal, and since I'm living with my parents for the time being, I had to get out of the house to feel through my emotions in private. And it was just... the most compelling feeling of peace I've experienced in a long time. Something about the music throbbing while I drove through a really heavy fog, only car on the road, with the streetlights glowing pretty colors through the mist, just got my thoughts flowing freely again.

I won't jump the gun and say I'm cured, but I did just resist some self destructive habits once I got home, and I'm now doing the coursework that I've been putting off at risk of failing out of school because I *just. didn't. have the energy for it*... So even if I wake up next week and I'm worse off and I feel silly for being optimistic, at least I got a precious window of peace and lucidity that helped me to at least pass the semester.

Oh, and getting pulled over! So, I was so absorbed with my thoughts, I was doing the drive on autopilot thing - see and react to things like red lights and sudden movements, but not really think about where I'm going. I was just navigating by instinct and I ended up going too far on a road and heading for the military base just outside town. Turns out, military cops don't really like it when you suddenly show up to their gates in the middle of the night with a car full of mysterious boxes (haven't fully unpacked yet), then suddenly freak out, turn around, drive on the wrong side of the road for a minute, then correct yourself and try to leave thinking nobody saw you being silly and stupid.

Anyway, the guy that immediately pulled me over was... just a really, really genuine human. He asked me how my night was going and I just explained the whole thing, the need to get out and clear my head, the reason I was too distracted to see the big ass signs about it being a military base (that's also due to the fog, it was incredibly thick, in my defense). Sounded like an absolute nervous wreck. And he listened. And he was really empathetic, just letting me off with a warning.

The funny thing is, I spent a while beating myself up, thinking ""man, this guy must think I'm some huge kind of stupid weak kid. He's a responsible ass adult, working a job in public safety, and here he is, having to chase down a stupid kid with a panic issue. All because *I* can't properly process my feelings.""

But I considered it for a bit, and I realized that this random cop, who doesn't owe me anything, who's shift I rudely interrupted, saw me in one of my worst states and still had it in him to treat me kindly and *listen* to me. Actually *listen* to what I was going through. And I realized that I haven't been doing that for myself.

Guys, see, I need to treat myself with the same empathy and sincerity that this cop treated me with. I need to listen to myself, and forgive myself \~\~even\~\~ *especially* when I'm in my worst states. Because the only way to leave those states is with love and support, and 90% of the time, when I'm not lucky enough to have this cop around, I need to provide that love and support for myself.

ka3csj,mentalhealth,1607556464.0,"Now, I am speaking from experience when I say that this statement does wayyyyyy more harm than it ever did good. My mother is an abusive POS, father was even worse before he was divorced. Routinely, I would go to over to videos on subreddits and just watch some posts there. I recently saw a post about parenting, and people in the comments all had the same general consensus that ""your child, your rules""

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Problem is, no one really gets all the possible ways that this could be applied. Sure, it is usually used for logical stuff like what religion the child is associated with or maybe whether the child is a vegetarian or a meat-eater. But have you thought this saying through? You're saying that it is this person's child, and that they should be able to make the rules. You are putting this person on one of the most dangerous power trips ever. Now, what would you do if you found out this person over/underfeeds their child? What if they feed the child too much junk, or strictly healthy foods without letting them have any junk food? What would you do if, whenever the child speaks up, they shut them down and go on a tangent before mentioning ""I'm your parent!""? Now do you see where I'm coming from? Look, that was pretty much my story, so I hope you really listen to what I'm saying. I'm 15 years old and I could tell you that shit is damaging. I don't need anyone going through something similar because people keep using this idiotic statement.   


  
And yes, I know this sounds like a giant hyperbole, but it really isn't.

c647ep,mentalhealth,1561633716.0,"I remember feeling pretty smart when I was a kid. Maybe that's just how all kids feel but that's what I remember ‚Äì getting better grades than most other kids. During my teenage years I didn't work very hard and still got good grades. I even got accepted into a school that only took on students that got good grades. That's when things started to change. Everyone seemed so much smarter than me and it was really scary. I went from feeling like one of the smartest guys in the room to the dumbest ‚Äì and I'd let myself know just how dumb I was, beating myself up.

Soon, I wasn't just stupid, I was boring. Then I was ugly and weak and pathetic in the eyes of everyone. I felt like I was getting dumber. A brain fog had permeated my mind ‚Äì I couldn't think as fast. My grades slipped as I worked even less and started playing video games more. Gaming takes up your attention and the thoughts more or less stop.

I still managed to get into a decent university but I was ashamed of my accomplishment because all my classmates were moving on to much more prestigious ones. I lasted two and a half years at uni before the suicidal thoughts started to become a real plan. Scared, friendless and far from home, I decided not to go through with it one night ‚Äì the worst night of my life. Instead I called my mom late that night and early the next morning I was on a train home.

Since then, I've been living with my mom. I work as a waiter and the job sees a high staff turnover with a majority of people working there being students trying to earn some money in between their studies. I can feel them judging me when I tell them that it's all I do ‚Äì I'm not doing this part time while I chase my dreams. I don't have anything else going on. I'm a 25yo man living with his mom and working a minimum wage job.

I got help, of course ‚Äì talking to some professionals and taking pills ‚Äì but the thoughts never really left. I know I'm not supposed to indulge them. My therapist told me, *you wouldn't say those things to your best friend so why would you say them to yourself?* I would reply that my best friend isn't trying to sabotage and fuck up my life. But I was never trying to do that and yet I felt like I deserved to hear the the things I was telling myself and deserved the life I now had because of how stupid and pathetic I was.

Recently, after doing something stupid but totally forgivable and human, I googled 'Is it possible to get dumber?' The first result was the question: *Is it psychologically possible to get dumber* on Quora. One of the answers by Norma Pellett:

> My experience tells me yes. I know a woman who was articulate and educated. I moved away and saw her again after ten years. She had no opinions of her own and couldn't articulate a decent sentence.

> I asked other friends if she had been ill or in an accident. No, she hadn't. Then I heard her husband talking to her. He called her ‚Äùstupid‚Äù and told her what she was doing was idiotic. He berated her for several more minutes. She was so cowed by this abuse that she bought into his assessment of her intelligence.
> She became what he expected her to be.
> I was too young and unsure of myself to call him on it or even to try to find a way to help her. I am ashamed that I didn't do anything.
> I'm not even sure that thirty years ago people really thought of emotional abuse as abuse. There were no bruises or broken bones, but this was much worse.
> Don't spend any time with someone who puts you down ‚Äî not even if they say, ‚Äújust kidding‚Äù or ‚Äúcan't you take a joke?‚Äù Months and years of this ‚Äúhumor‚Äù can destroy anyone.

Abuse is a terrible thing and I don't want to diminish it or its victims but I couldn't help but compare the husband to the voice in my head. The abuse I put myself through. I imagine having another person tell you those things is a thousand times worse.

I have always thought that a smart person was smart no matter what. That they may not believe it and people might tell them otherwise but they were, unchangeably, smart. Maybe it's obvious to everyone else but it never occurred to me that people could become the person they were told they are. That their personality could be moulded. What my therapist should have told me is *You wouldn't emotionally abuse another person so why would you emotionally abuse yourself?* Thinking of it that way it's hard to feel like I deserve it. There is not a person in the world that I believe deserves abuse.

So how to stop? It's important not to try telling yourself the opposite of the things you usually tell yourself. I'm not going to look in the mirror every day and tell myself I'm smart, confident, handsome etc. That just feels inauthentic and quite silly. What you have to do instead is learn to recognise the thoughts and externalize them ‚Äì think of them as not your own but rather your anxiety's or your depression's. Your illness is your own personal abuser. Then the next step will be to stop believing the thoughts by not giving them your attention. Don't think the opposite or try to argue with them (e.g. *I'm not ugly I'm beautiful*) instead, try to refocus on whatever it is you were doing. This is hard but can get easier with practice. Mindfulness meditations help. You can even try talking back to the thoughts as though you aren't taking them seriously, *Thanks anxiety, tell me that again! C'mon that's what you always say. Ha, that's a good one. I was hoping you were going to show up.*

I feel so far behind everyone else but I'm going to really try getting better this time.",https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/c647ep/you_wouldnt_emotionally_abuse_another_person_so/,You wouldn't emotionally abuse another person so why would you emotionally abuse yourself?,,355,22,0.99

My friend tried to commit suicide last night. I watched him drive away in his car drunk and he went on the highway/motorway saying he didn‚Äôt care if he died. Tried to stop him but couldn‚Äôt. That‚Äôs not the issue though. 

I had no idea he was suicidal, his family had no idea he was suicidal, his friends had no idea. He‚Äôd kept his mouth shut and let these feelings fester. 

The conversation about male mental health is nowhere near what it needs to be. It is heading in the right direction sure, but at the moment it only seems to be a big deal when someone is on the brink of suicide or having severe depression. 

There is no emphasis on normal day to day life, people telling young boys to man up if they are upset. Saying be a man. This is vile behaviour and forces boys to stuff down their feelings and deal with it through anger since they feel they can‚Äôt talk it through. Even saying it to girls shows them that this is how they should act and that boys should act differently when it comes to feelings. 

In the US four times as many suicides are by males. 9% have daily anxiety or depression. Of those 9% only a quarter found help for it according to the national health survey 2010-13
Source: https://www.apa.org/monitor/2015/12/numbers

In the UK 76% of suicides are carried out by males and 12.5% men are affected by depression. Of the people that seek help through therapy only 36% are men. Then the most shocking stat from the UK, of all the things that kill men under 45, getting hit by a car, murder, heart attacks etc, the leading cause of death is suicide. I am an under 45 male in the UK and to know that the most likely way for me to die statistically is for me to kill myself is shocking and scary. 

Only 15% of men report they would take time off work to focus on mental health. 34% would feel embarrassed or ashamed to do so for a mental health issue compared to the 15% feeling ashamed for a physical injury. 38% would feel that their employer would look down on them for taking time off for a mental health issue compared to the 26% for a physical.

Even among my friends this sort of ‚Äúman up talk‚Äù happens where if a guy gets upset over something deemed trivial he gets told to stop being a girl. I personally am quite sensitive, when I get super angry I tend to tear up. I hate it because it sometimes weakens my argument but it‚Äôs just how I am. When I get angry I tear up. It‚Äôs not a ‚Äúsad cry‚Äù I‚Äôm just angry. 

 I had an argument with a close female friend and she said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm only joking, so stop crying and grow a pair, man up‚Äù. That says my feelings aren‚Äôt allowed because I‚Äôm male, because apparently I‚Äôm not supposed  to feel that way. I should be calm and collected at all times. But all that does is make my squash my feelings away and deal with them some other way. 

That other way can turn into depression and eventually suicide. 

We need to change the mental health conversation so that it‚Äôs not a conversation about men on the brink of suicide.

A cancer patient has the right to refuse treatment, and their affliction is lethal. Why don‚Äôt I have the right to say no? Because ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt think clearly about the consequences of my actions‚Äù? Cancer patients can‚Äôt comprehend what it is to die, none of us can. How about parents of kids with lethal illnesses? They can refuse treatment to their child for religious reasons, religion in and of itself is delusion. So why is their delusion given more weight than when I point out fact? When what I‚Äôm saying can be proven. When what I‚Äôm saying is logical, because let‚Äôs fucking face it, nobody in their right mind would take these fucking pills. They put me on 8mg of risperdal for my first antipsychotic. 8. Fucking. Milligrams. It didn‚Äôt work. Nor did my dick. Nor did my appetite. Nor did my brain. You all expect me to just play along and trust that you all have my best interest in mind and it‚Äôs fucking disgusting. YOU have NO interest in my long-term health.

And I won‚Äôt have it.

Edit: for those of you who underestimate even just the metabolic damage these drugs cost I will give you first hand what my experience was. When I started the risperidone (risperdal) I wanted to be and stay healthy. To an obsessive amount. I ate in a 500 calorie deficit of only healthy Whole Foods, lots of vegetables, lean meat, no processed garbage. I went to the gym 6 times a week, did a full body split workout regiment with weights, and then went on the treadmill for an hour and ran 10km, then I went on the stair master for half an hour at as difficult a pace I could manage. I was easily burning 1,000 calories per session from the cardio alone. I GAINED 15 pounds. Eating in a deficit, running 6.2 miles 6 times a week, plus 30 minutes of stair master. I would run on shin splints and stress fractures I didn‚Äôt care that it hurt it just felt so amazing to accomplish what I could. But I was getting literally fatter by the day. I was obsessed. I‚Äôve never had issues with eating disorders or body dysmorphia (unless looking in the mirror and seeing a different face counts but that‚Äôs not the same thing) these drugs make weight-loss or maintenance borderline impossible. Many people who go on antipsychotics struggle for years to lose the weight and many never get back to their original weight. These drugs make you hungry in a way that‚Äôs almost indescribable. It‚Äôs a hunger in your intestines, and no matter how much you fill your stomach your intestines still hurt, they ache and cramp as they tell you desperately that you need food. You eat and eat and you can‚Äôt fucking stop. I ate 6 heads of lettuce in one sitting and was still STARVING. That‚Äôs so much volume and fiber nobody should be able to consume that much lettuce, but it didn‚Äôt even phase me.

Edit 2: for those stating antipsychotic medication does not reduce lifespan by 20 years, this statement comes from the overall life expectancy of schizophrenics being reduced by 20 years, and the leading cause of death for schizophrenics being Cardiovascular Disease. As previously stated, Antipsychotic medication is directly linked to metabolic damage and cardiovascular disease, which allows me to make the correlation between antipsychotics and lifespan.",https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/pkrtbo/i_am_schizophrenic_i_have_the_right_to_say_no/,I am schizophrenic.

Just about one year ago, my OCD caused me to suffer (another) complete mental and emotional breakdown/collapse, culminating in an unsuccessful suicide attempt. Being in such an unstable state is one thing, but then being quarantined and unemployed made things...dark. Horrific, really. I spent every waking and sleeping moment in bed, trying to escape the confines of my own mind. I would go a week without showering, wearing the same sweats and t-shirt every day. I very nearly attempted suicide again.

Before the day I ""broke"", I had emptied my dresser and closet, and did a giant wash of almost every item of everyday wear I owned, clothes for all seasons. And for the next year, they lay in assorted baskets strewn across the laundry room, untouched and unexplored.

jp6m2x,mentalhealth,1604675002.0," I had been sexually abused by my grandfather for 3-4 years, literally all of my early childhood - I do not have a single memory before him abusing me. My parents found out after constantly punishing me for masturbating (in my room), wetting the bed, having outbursts, etc. There was legal action taken, I was in counseling for the bare minimum time. 

 I had horrible nightmares, night terrors, I sleptwalked. My parents literally punished me for getting out of bed and waking my mom (who was a stay at home mom with all of her kids being in school for 8 hours out of the day) up because I had nightmares that made me feel terrified, paralyzed, and unable to go back to sleep. 

 On one specific occasion, I remember being in the 3rd or 4th grade (only 1-2 years after the abuse had ended) and waking my mom up because I had a nightmare about dolls trying to kill me. My parents were so mad that my dad made me sleep with the light on in an attempt to make it where I couldn't sleep, when I did fall asleep that night he came in and intentionally woke me up telling me I didn't deserve to be asleep, I was going to learn a lesson about waking my mom up, and that he hoped I didn't sleep all night (I had school the next morning). On top of all of that, they made me stay home from a party that everyone else got to go to (my mom stayed home with me). When they got back my sister had brought me candy, he said I wasn't allowed to have it. He also made a point of saying how everyone asked where I was and he told EVERYONE why I couldn't be there, and he made me feel guilty for my mom not being able to go and having to stay home. 

  I confronted my mom about it today (I'm 24) and she just immediately started saying the typical, ""Oh yeah we get it, we're terrible parents, your childhood was terrible."" She then kept saying I never told them I was having nightmares even though I remember ALWAYS telling them about my nightmares and the only time I didn't get punished was the night I had a nightmare about someone shooting my family because that was deemed realistic enough to be afraid. I told her all I wanted her to do was apologize and she full out said she will never apologize and to leave her alone.

  I got frustrated and sarcastically asked if they were never told I would have PTSD after being abused my entire childhood, she said no. So I asked if they seriously didn't have enough common sense to think maybe their child was traumatized and she said no. 

  My parents were so focused on making me ""normal"" that they traumatized me worse than that abuse ever did and they won't even acknowledge that they did anything wrong.",https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/jp6m2x/my_parents_punished_me_for_having_ptsd/,My Parents Punished me for Having PTSD,,350,36,0.99

A Letter To Those Wanting To Understand Their Loved Ones With Mental Illness,

If you are reading this as one of **many** who doesn‚Äôt understand what it‚Äôs like to deal with mental illness, I am very happy you don‚Äôt experience firsthand what I and so many others have to experience on a daily basis because...

**I would not wish this pain on my worst enemy.**

**I am so happy** you don‚Äôt have to experience feeling that no one in your life truly loves or cares about you, despite them reassuring you that they do on almost a daily basis.

**I am so happy** you haven‚Äôt had to answer any of the further questions that follow ‚Äúdo you feel anxious or depressed?‚Äù when visiting the doctor‚Äôs office.

**I am so happy** you have never thought the world is better without you in it.

If you have never had to leave a party because of a sudden wave of anxiety or sadness, *I really hope it stays that way.*

If you are able to get out of bed without feeling nauseous with anxiety or the weight of depression, *appreciate it* every single day**.**

**Don‚Äôt ever take it for granted.**

Don‚Äôt let a day go by without appreciating how *beautiful* life is and can be. Because many of us, myself included, aren‚Äôt always able to see that beauty, no matter how hard we try.

While mental illness is something that is so wrongfully romanticized in the movies, **it is very ugly in real life.** Mental illness is not **‚Äúquirky‚Äù** or **‚Äúpoetic‚Äù** like society makes it seem on social media.

Being mentally ill isn‚Äôt *aesthetic worthy,* mascara filled tears with sad music in the background; mental illness is barely being able to keep up basic personal hygiene because it feels almost physically **impossible** to get out of bed. 

**Mental illness makes the world seem pointless.** 

So when a loved one approaches you seeking comfort or a listening ear, please don‚Äôt automatically assume it is an annoying cry for attention. Because I promise you, that assumption is our **worst fear.**

**The last thing we wish for is to be a burden on the ones we love.**

Isn‚Äôt it ironic that even when we are struggling, our first thought is to not make our loved ones uncomfortable?

And when we cancel plans or fail to stay around the entirety of a social outing, don‚Äôt take it personally.Trust me, we already beat ourselves up for it enough already because we finally put ourselves first for once, even though that is what we should‚Äôve been doing all along. 

When we isolate ourselves from you and push you away, don‚Äôt think it is us being rude. We are just trying to do what we can to feel like we aren‚Äôt dragging you down with us.

Please do not blame us for the cards we got dealt, we deal with them the best we are able to, even if it means pushing loved ones away to avoid getting hurt. 

Most of all, see mental illness as you would any broken bone or any physical sickness.**It hurts just as bad and is equally out of our control.**So, while we don‚Äôt wish you would first handedly understand, we want you to **be patient** and understand the best you are able to.

**We are fighting an invisible illness that we aren‚Äôt always sure we can beat.**

However, even with this ongoing battle to stay afloat in our own minds filled with endless thoughts, **not every single day is a bad one.** 

In fact, we go through periods of time where everything feels alright again for a while. So when those good days finally come around, we appreciate it and never take it for granted. 

Because to those who struggle with mental illness, it is a privilege to feel the true happiness that **everyone** deserves to feel every day.

Sincerely,

The mentally ill",https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/jwz8qk/a_letter_to_those_wanting_to_understand_their/,A Letter To Those Wanting To Understand Their Loved Ones With Mental Illness,,341,34,0.99
eq7t8i,mentalhealth,1579300993.0,"Hey guys,

We are a group of high school students who are committed to solving the mental health issues of today through awareness and policy. The mental health crisis is one of the most prevalent issues facing the American population today, not only the youth. 

We are also compiling a list of candidate endorsements who are pledging to focus on mental health reform once they are inaugurated.

In fact, 1 in 5 American adults experience some form of mental illness each year (National Alliance on Mental Illness), while only 41% receive proper treatment (Mental Health First Aid). This is unacceptable, and we demand action now.

We‚Äôve witnessed these problems in our own schools and neighborhoods, and we believe it is time for us as a country to step up and pass bold solutions to protect everyday people. 

We are also asking you to sign and share our petition (https://www.change.org/p/u-s-congress-pass-comprehensive-mental-health-legislation-now ) to ask Congress and the President to commit to comprehensive mental health reform to ensure that everyone has access to quality mental health care.

Thank you.

Edit: Thanks for the overwhelming support, we would never have dreamt of getting almost 350 upvotes in only one day. We have just started a GoFundMe in order to raise money to increase the awareness of this crisis on more platforms such as 
Instagram, Twitter, and Google.

At first it seemed very cute and sweet, like a ‚ÄúCrush‚Äù sort of thing. Through this past few years it has been escalating to a point where it is creepy and I fear for her mental health and future safety. I‚Äôm telling this story as a way of trying to get some opinions. 

Let‚Äôs call her Cindy, she is a daughter of a cousin of mine who I am not that close to, but we still get along pretty well. I‚Äôm going to share some anecdotes so you all can see what I mean. 

We come from a family where reunions and parties are common and happen at least once a month. So, we all see each other frequently. Cindy always wants to be around me, she wants me to play with her and hold her every minute of every single reunion. Whenever I dare to hug, say hi, or even acknowledge any other member of the family (especially when it comes to younger females of the family) she would get upset and throw a tantrum, running away onto the streets. Whenever the family starts dancing outside (which is pretty often lol) Cindy makes me pick her up and dance with her. I can only dance with her, no other female is allowed near me, I can‚Äôt even put her down to go the bathroom or have a drink. And whenever I did put her down well‚Ä¶ temper tantrum time. 

She once smacked her youngest sister (Mia, 2-year-old) so hard it almost knocked her out, just because she was walking around the house, spotted me, smiled, and wanted to get close to say hi. 

Anytime another female of the family would bring me something to eat or drink, she would make me give it back or throw it away so she could go and bring me whatever I had just been given. 

One time I did not show up to one of those reunions because some other plan that sounded more fun came around (dick move I know). Cindy asked everyone a thousand times where I was, and why I wasn‚Äôt showing up. Eventually they got tired of her and decided to call me, I explained that I was hanging out with some friends. When they told her about this, she got furious, grabbed a stone and threw it at the nearest car, breaking one of the windows. She then locked herself up inside one of the rooms. 

3 or 4 times a week, Cindy‚Äôs mom would call me, telling me Cindy wanted me to come over so I could help her with her homework. Sometimes, her other sister (8-year-old) would ask for my help too, causing Cindy to flip out, throw things at her, and call her names. Whenever I refused the invitation to help Cindy with her hw, she would start ripping her notebooks and textbooks, or pouring water on them. 

She then started to force her parents to bring her to my place every other day, even if it was for a short visit. This One time they left her with me because they needed someone to watch her to do some errands. Cindy was in my room, and I left for a couple of minutes to get her some snacks. When I came back, I found her going thru my clothes. She started crying and said she wanted to steal one of my t-shirts so she could remember me with it. I thought it was kind weird, but cute in a way. I told her she could have one of her choosing. Each time she came over after that she demanded a new shirt to take. I told her I couldn‚Äôt give her anymore shirts because I don‚Äôt have many. (which is true) Every time she would come, we would have the exact same conversation, until, without me noticing, she took pretty much all my shirts and stuffed them inside her backpack. Her mother had to come back the next day and give them back. 

I used to play along and not say much to her or her mother because, like I said, I thought it just was a ‚Äúcrush‚Äù or just a little girl overly attached to an older family member. It escalated gradually to a point which I didn‚Äôt know what to do. And besides, I‚Äôm really not into confrontation, so I didn‚Äôt want to cause any trouble. 

Last time I saw Cindy was this past weekend. (another family reunion) but this time, I brought my new girlfriend with me (she was my best friend for 6 years but I escaped the friendzone haha). Cindy was using crutches because she had gotten injured doing something or other while at school, so she couldn‚Äôt follow me around like she usually does. 

Obviously, she got furious when she met my girlfriend, but she didn‚Äôt say much. She sat right between us and didn‚Äôt let us kiss, hug or dance. Laura (my gf) Went to grab a drink for both of us, and immediately Cindy started moving around so she was occupying the rest of the sofa. When Laura came back, she refused to move and let her sit. I lost my patience (even when I lose my patience, I‚Äôm still pretty chill) and told her that she was being mean to my GF and that meant she was also being mean to me. I also told her we (Me and Laura) would have to leave if she kept it up.

Cindy lost it, she started screaming and kicking, she called Laura every name in the book and finished by saying that if we continued being together, she would shoot us both with his father‚Äôs gun. Turns out my cousin is not very bright, and it took her this long to realize something might be wrong with her daughter. My cousin pulled me aside and I told her everything, everything I just told you and a lot more. I advised her to seek help for Cindy and told her it was best if I stayed away for a while. 

Im really worried about Cindy and her wellbeing. So please, if anyone has gone thru something similar, or if some of you understand what is going on and what can I do to help. I would gladly listen.

People are angry at each other from all over the globe. Whether if it's because of politics, the pandemic, race, cops, etc. It just feels like everywhere people are just angry. If they aren't angry then they are most likely depressed given the state of the world and what's been going on. When you think of all those things together it really makes you feel like life has been shit and still is.   


The folks on the news always seem like they are either angry at something or have something negative to talk about. The people around me are uneasy with what's been going on. Jobs have been hard to come by when taking the pandemic into consideration. If you don't want to work with other people because you are scared of the virus that's a huge chunk of jobs you can't get. Even if you get a job it's been tough trying to get a place to live comfortably. The folks I know that have a place either work 90% of their week, have two jobs or are unable to treat themselves because they can't afford to.  


The most frustrating about all this is the lack of attention mental health has been getting. At least on a national level.  All you hear is cases and deaths with very few articles mentioning mental health. When you do they are actually talking about people who have Covid or have had Covid are experiencing depression. Like you can't have mental health issues without Covid? What kind of nonsense is that? Vaccines came out which you would think is something we should be hopeful for the news tries to scare people with ""hesitancy may stop us from going back to normal"".

Therapy is not about commiseration and it‚Äôs never about sympathy. Too many of the posts I read involve a thought process that is dangerous to clients. Some border on codependency.
Additionally, if you have the mindset that only a certain type of person can ‚Äúfully understand‚Äù a client, go find something else. Maybe try coding or barber school. Why? Because, instilling the belief in a person that only people who have experienced identical circumstances to theirs can understand them, handicaps them and places huge barriers in their path to healing.

* Find a mirror where you can be alone and undisturbed
* Then look at yourself. Really, look into your eyesNo preening, no posing
* Breathe slowlyUnclench your jaw
* Ease your shoulders down
* Unclench your toesOne more breath

Now say to yourself:

>I am going to take care of you

>You're going to be OK

fvvdq3,mentalhealth,1586163588.0,"I‚Äôve [24/f] always been terrible at responding to texts, answering phone calls, joining FaceTime group sessions, and being outgoing. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs some deep rooted fear of rejection or what. I remember when I was younger, I was so so scared of going to peoples doors to ask if they wanted to come out and play, and the one time I mustered up all my mental strength to do it, the mum told me that my friend didn‚Äôt want to come outside to play. It sounds like a small thing, but I remember how badly that set me back. 

Now, I‚Äôm 24 years old and struggle tremendously with making effort with friends. Sometimes I doubt if my connections with friends is even real, because I act different with all of them. I adapt, and have done for years, and it‚Äôs tiring. I‚Äôm just at a stage in my life where I want to address what‚Äôs going on with me, and try to better myself. My flat mate has just messaged me asking if I want to renew our house contract for next year (which I don‚Äôt) and as a result I‚Äôve been suffering from crippling stomach knots all morning and have been running on and off to the toilet. 

I don‚Äôt know if any of this makes sense at all? Or if my point is even clear? I just want to know if anyone else experiences this. It would really help to know I‚Äôm not alone. What have people done to overcome this?

j1f7n9,therapy,1601310350.0,"I am really ashamed of this, and I hate this about myself, but I know deep down it‚Äôs true. I have this kind of childish urge to remain ill, this resistance to recovery. I‚Äôve been diagnosed with depression, anxiety and ADHD. More recently, bipolar disorder. 

I mean I don‚Äôt like being depressed, and if there was a pill that would make me happier, more focused and more motivated I would take it. In fact I do take antidepressants and stimulants, without any reluctance. I love them. I don‚Äôt like being tired, boring, lazy and sad. 

On the other hand, I am reluctant to help myself. Three main reasons:

1.) Maingl, I‚Äôm afraid of the unknown, lazy, rather used to it and unmotivated. I feel unsure of what the future looks like and what I even want it to look like. I feel hopeless about my ability to change very much at all, considering my track record. Most of all, I‚Äôm lazy. All have been, I don‚Äôt want to work hard on anything.

2.), I‚Äôm afraid of accepting responsibility for my flaws without any recourse to mental illness. Im acutely aware of all of my weaknesses, some in my control, some less so, but all possible to improve (for example, social awkwardness, weight, lack of verbal communication skills, laziness, flakiness, impulse to lie, tendency to steal, self absorption, pretentiousness, romanticism, disorganization, overly sensitive, entitled, easily frustrated, tendency to give up, not always a good listener, mental slowness, lack of life experiences, lack of certain life skills, responsibilities, maturity, relationship skills, etc.). I am very ashamed of these. I do feel inadequate and deficient in so many ways. I‚Äôm afraid of having to face all of my weakness ness, and for other people to witness those weaknesses, without being able to invoke mental health as an explanation/excuse. I feel like people will reject me, judge me, criticize me more harshly for these traits unless I have some kind of unless I‚Äôm a victim of some sort. I feel like it‚Äôs not okay to be this flawed without either things that compensate for my flaws, or some kind of tragic circumstances. I‚Äôm afraid of the judgement of others and depression, fragility, low self esteem is a surprisingly good shied against that. 

3.) this one‚Äôs the most shameful but... It makes me feel special and more likeable/loveable. I think I have a victim mentality that I'm addicted to. At the same time I see how unattractive that is, and I know that I am a victim of no one but myself. I try to always blame myself, never blame other people and never complain about my situation, unless I'm complaining about myself, but even that feeds into the victim mentality. I actually think I use self-loathing as a way to mask the fact that I feel like/want to be a victim (and then do actually hate myself for wanting that). Does that make any sense? 

Deep down I realize the reason I'm not recovering is because I don't want to. I don't actually believe, or let myself believe, I'm a victim. At least that‚Äôs what I tell myself. I try to tell myself that I cause most of my own suffering and I generally do believe that. Yet I still want others to see me as a victim, as bad as that sounds. Even worse, i do not want people to see through this, to see that I *want* to be seen as a victim (even though it's true). 

It's a part of myself I really don‚Äôt like, and I don't think many others would/do either. I both genuinely dislike myself and also also use it, perpetuate it, as a means to an end. I use my own self-hate as a way to try and avoid or mask any trace of self-pity, but conveniently also elicit compassion in others. 

I'm sure others can see through this facade which I am only just now starting to see through as well. This makes me feel like one of the most insufferable kinds of people but it‚Äôs also kind of liberating because it‚Äôs the kind of awareness I need to finally change after years of the same self destructive behavior.

I think I also believed at some level that if I hated myself enough it would somehow make me a good person. That sounds crazy but it‚Äôs true, like somehow hyper awareness of my bad side could purge me of it, magically. But now I see through that and have to deal with the fact that I have good reasons to dislike myself. Not quite, but you know what I mean. That I'm not innocent.

There is also a part of me that does want to get better. But there is another part of me that doesn't, and right now that part is winning. 

I honestly feel too old for this (23), like something an angsty teenager would feel but then grow out of. I really don‚Äôt like this part of me, but I feel like I can't help that I want what I want (to stay depressed and timid and get sympathy and attention from others). I know it‚Äôs really immature. I find it repulsive that I am like this. I've always felt drawn to darkness and suffering and being a victim even though I genuinely don't think I'm a victim of anyone anymore but myself. I understand why I want to be a victim, but I find it both unacceptable and impossible to stop wanting.",https://www.reddit.com/r/therapy/comments/j1f7n9/i_think_deep_down_i_want_to_stay_depressed_and/,"I think deep down I want to stay depressed and have low self esteem because I am secretly afraid of losing the sympathy, kindness and attention I get from being this way",,337,35,0.99

hbkbft,mentalhealth,1592505777.0,"Hello, trapped in quarantine here and nobody to talk to so I‚Äôve chosen to write it out. I (24f) was raped by my own cousin for over a year when I was 14 years old. Story started with force, him moving my hand, forcing my head down, holding me down, locking me in cars, etc. Same things that are pretty common with those raped by family members. What I want to talk about is the aftermath. What nobody really realizes. My virginity wasn‚Äôt lost the same way as my friends growing up, I felt my body was meant to be used because that‚Äôs all he told me I was good for. So I believed him. After having that happen to you for that long you begin to go numb. It starts out with fighting then when you realize there isn‚Äôt anything you can do after fighting screaming and clawing you way out for months you just give in and want to get it over with. I don‚Äôt feel like my body is mine, I don‚Äôt have a connection with sex. I hear stories of people having sexual partners because they are in love or want to share that with their partners, but I have always viewed sex as my duty. It was my job to make men feel nice, I never had a right to say no. Still feel like I don‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt have connections with people, every friend I push away because I don‚Äôt ‚Äúfit in‚Äù with them. I‚Äôm disconnected from what your typical 24 year old would want to do (drink, party, yoga, etc) my focus for the time I‚Äôve grown up is to just make sure it doesn‚Äôt happen again. Survivor mentality if you will... I‚Äôm not saying all this to feel sorry for myself. It happens to a lot of people. But what happened to me made me feel like a outcast, I can‚Äôt share ‚Äúlosing my virginity‚Äù stories because it wasn‚Äôt funny or cute. I can‚Äôt stay in relationships with... well anyone because I don‚Äôt trust people because if family can hurt me in that way what‚Äôs to stop others. I don‚Äôt talk to friends (don‚Äôt have any), I‚Äôve lost a lot of my family due to what happened and the family I haven‚Äôt lost like my mom, dad, and brother I don‚Äôt talk to them anymore because they don‚Äôt understand why I‚Äôve changed so much from the happy go lucky ‚Äúpretty teenage girl‚Äù to the cold hearted one I am today. Nobody can help you but yourself. I‚Äôve been told over and over again to ‚Äújust get over it‚Äù but here we are, 10 years later. And I‚Äôm over what happened to me, it doesn‚Äôt haunt me like it use to. But that doesn‚Äôt mean it didn‚Äôt permanently change me. My ability to form relationships, my mentality, my hobbies, my happiness, or my thought processes all have been changed because of one person 10 years ago. So for those that have been raped, you don‚Äôt have to just get over it, you don‚Äôt have to just bury it, but you can build because of it. I‚Äôm a strong person because of it, just isolated. So if you guys have any questions like how to help those that have been through it I will try to answer to the best of my abilities as another survivor. Thanks for reading.

But looking for that something, that one thing that's gonna turn their struggle around. 

Sometimes a particular post will catch my eye and I'll interact, but for the most part I watch time after time as people, mostly young people, reach out for somebody's hand and no one is there to respond. I don't view this as any one person or group of people's fault, I just think the sheer numbers of those looking for real help overwhelm the number of people qualified and/or willing enough to provide it by such a large margin that a lot of the sub continually consists of largely ignored cries for help. 

I wonder what impact this has on the greater good that all of us try to do for ourselves or other people when it comes to providing mental health care, referrals, and advice. I wonder if there's a way it could be done better by all of us involved not only with our mental health for one reason or another, but with our specific involvement in the sub.

I lost all my hobbies and a big chuck of my personality. I was a shell.

I've since overcome that part of my life and am left with this same shell. I dont particularly have anything that makes me me anymore. I don't have the patience/strength to really finish anything I start (eg artwork or writing) and when I don't finish it it brings me down more.

Essentialy I don't have a personality. I think I'm very boring and have crippling social skills. I don't know how I would go about trying to fix this.

My lack of social skills (due to isolating myself through arguably the most important part of my life, development wise) has also resulted in me loosing all my friends and unable to reconcile or make new ones.

I figure I can't be the only one going through this or something similar and wonder why this big part of this mental illness isn't really talked about

I have severe  anxiety about going into new places, that is manageable when I‚Äôm with my boyfriend, but when I‚Äôm by myself.... I just cannot cope. The thought of going to the hospital and having to navigate it myself was far too much.

If I had gone to the hospital I would‚Äôve been able to tel him one last time that I loved him.

I used the chat line because I get too anxious when i have to talk on the phone and the guy was really helpful and he asked me if i had a plan and I lied and told him no because I was afraid of what would happen if I did tell him that I have a plan to kill myself so I told him that I was just having thoughts of suicide and that I didn't have a plan to kill myself. Then we just talked about what was going on and what's making me feeling this way and then we came up with a plan on what I could do tonight to keep myself distracted and busy and he gave me some coping mechanism that I could use. I talked to him for about 40 minutes and he told my that I could always contact the hotline again if the thoughts comes back. Honestly the suicide hotline did help me this time and I felt a little better after talking with them.

""Are you sure the therapist isn't laughing at you right now? She probably thinks you're undeserving of the help but she wants the money"" ""your mom would say you're being ridiculous right now."" ""Your problems are stupid compared to [x]""

Throwaway account for reasons that may be obvious and a **Spoiler** for season 3 of the show.

Let me start off by giving you guys some backstory. I have been in therapy for a wide array of issues: Compulsive spending, depression, anxiety, manic episodes, suicidal attempts. I attempted many times to get a diagnosis but I wouldn't share any embarrassing details that I will share with you. Every psychiatrist I would see would base these disorders off as the result of childhood trauma and an absent father. I was on all the medications you‚Äôve probably heard of Buspar, Prozac, Xanax, and Zoloft. 

My relationships have never really been stable in both interpersonal and romantic areas. I‚Äôve had 3 romantic relationships my entire life with the longest relationship lasting 6 months. Whenever I developed feelings for someone it would turn into severe infatuation where it went as far as stalking, rearranging my work schedule to be able to interact with him, and try to change my physical appearance in order to get them to fall for me. I am not proud of any of this but I need to stop denying that this was happening. With friendships, whenever a friend would cancel plans like drinks at the bar I would fall into a severe depression where suicidal thoughts would come to mind. I would call these friends and tell them I was considering suicide in order to get them to come see me. 

My manic episodes started getting pretty severe over the past few months to the point where I would take a week off from work and take lavish spontaneous trips to Europe, I started having auditory hallucinations of a ‚Äòsane me‚Äô insulting me and calling me crazy. I would go to Vegas on weekends to go on an alcohol binger and have numerous random sexual encounters. I would also lock myself in my room after work and watch TV for 6 hours straight. I will admit, I was too ashamed to open up about this as I was scared of being institutionalized and being known in my family as the freak.

In August, I wanted to start watching a new show and came across the show Crazy Ex-Girlfriend. I had heard of the show before but because of the name I thought it was related to the meme I had grown annoyed of so I never really gave it a chance. As I started watching I was horrified that there were a few similarities between myself and the character Rebecca Bunch, the stalking, lavish spending, fear of abandonment, the hallucinations. The fact that she was the titular ‚ÄúCrazy Ex-Girlfriend‚Äù left me in a slight depression and I almost stopped watching. However when I reached season 3 where Rebecca finally gets diagnosed with Borderline Personality Disorder. I decided to finally go to a new psychiatrist to get another opinion and decided not to hold back any information that I was scared would be regarded as ‚Äòcrazy‚Äô people behavior. Thanks to the show‚Äôs portrayal of mental illness, I was finally able to open up about the stalking, the auditory hallucinations, and everything in between. After 12 years of therapy my official diagnosis is Self-Destructive Borderline and while the road to recovery will be a long one, I am hopeful that someday I will be able to completely manage my BPD. If you're currently going through something similar know that you aren't alone and the medical professionals are there to help you not judge you.

TLDR; Was an undiagnosed Borderline for 12 years but thanks to the show‚Äôs portrayal of mental illness I finally opened up about topics I was ashamed to admit, finally getting an accurate diagnosis.",https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/9uie1q/i_was_finally_accurately_diagnosed_after_12_years/,I was finally accurately diagnosed after 12 years thanks to the show 'Crazy Ex-Girlfriend',,327,12,0.98

I explained why he can't and that we need to trim some of his hair to deal with the damage he did to it. It was pretty torn up in one spot. His is super proud of his long hair. It was down to the middle of his back when it is wet and to his shoulders dry because of his curls. 

My mom when to beauty school years ago and offered to cut it for me. I was very hesitant because my family jokes about cutting his hair behind my back. I told her to only cut it to his shoulders but she gave him basically her hair cut which it the short old lady cut that she and my grandma have. It looks awful and I asked her to stop but she kept insisting that she needed to even it out. 

By the time she was done I was in tears. I ran out to the car to calm down so the kids didn't see me cry. My mom came out and made jokes about how I'm not speaking to her and laughed and asked if she could cut my hair next. 

I took the kids home and fed them and attempted to put his hair in his braids that I always do but it is too short. I had a full meltdown after the kids when to bed and basically hyperventilated on my kitchen floor. I'm so angry that my chest hurts and I asked my son after I was calm what he wanted to do with it and he said ""please, don't take any more of my hair."" I know I'm more upset then he is.

It was a fun night, and afterwards I fell asleep. I woke up some time later with someone spooning me, groping me, and kissing the back of my neck. I tried to push them off, I had no idea who it was or what was happening.

I didn't want it to happen but I let it happen anyway, i could've protested more maybe if i did it wouldn't of happened. I went home. I was bleeding a lot, one of my roommate noticed and asked me what happened, after a while of her whining I told her and she said ""well that's what you get for whoring around"".

mwwo59,mentalhealth,1619188583.0,"This may not apply to everyone. But for me, a person who is severely addicted to instagram and messaging apps, it's just really liberating. I bought this locking device that allows you to lock something in it and set a time for it to reopen (not naming any brand here, everyone please don't make this a post about products). I started out by locking my phone for a few hours, then a whole day, and eventually a whole weekend.

It is surprisingly beneficial to my mental health. I am a hypersensitive type and love to overread and overthink anything anyone say to me. And I also don't have a life. So what happen is that I need to constantly chat with my friends and family, even to the point that may annoy them, and when they show a lil bit of disinterest, even when they are really just busy, I'd literally feel hurt, it sounds so stupid to say such thing as a grown ass person, but yes, and I really hate myself for that.

Once I locked my phone, my brain will immediately try to find substitutes to generate the same stimulation, sometimes I'd use my computer to browse the internet but using the computer just never brings me the same negativity that a phone does, same as how youtube and reddit are somehow just much less toxic than ig and whatsapp to me. I don't play video games and my social circles don't use facebook anymore, so I normally can shut my computer pretty quick because I feel bored again.

And weird enough the next thing I know is that I find myself actually get up from my lazy ass and start doing things like chores, sorting mails and even doing some exercise. I don't think I am anywhere near being mentally healthy, but seriously I am much much better off without that damn phone.

Edit: Sorry guys I can't pm the brand of the device, it's against the rule, you can generally search timed locking box and anything similar will do. There are many boxes that do it.

v2a8on,mentalhealth,1654064006.0,"I've spent a lot of time scrolling various mental health subs on reddit or other subs that encourage venting or advice-seeking. Sometimes, I come across posts by people who are describing the unthinkable:

They might be afraid they're attracted to a family member, afraid they may be a pedophile, afraid they'll choke their cat, afraid they'll commit homicide. 

In almost all of these posts, I can clearly tell what they are describing is undiagnosed OCD. Other people don't seem to see that, though. Commentors respond with vitriol, disgust, hatred, ""You need to get some serious help."" Which puts someone with OCD into a place where their ocd gets life threateningly worse-- because people just told them they are what they fear they are. EVEN THOUGH they are most likely the opposite.

Not to say that every time I see someone post about these violent or unspeakable thoughts I assume it's definitely ocd. Rather, I notice the following:

*They are afraid they will act on these thoughts

*They are trying to get reassurance that they won't act on these thoughts 

*They don't like these thoughts. These thoughts are distressing

*The way they describe their thoughts clearly describes intrusive thoughts just without the vocabulary

*They describe compulsions without knowing they are compulsions

*Their post *is* a compulsion (reassurance-seeking, checking, researching, confessing)

The list goes on.

I have OCD. I actually have hospitalized myself because I believed I was going to kill my parents, sister, or classmates. I believed I was going to kill my cat at the time. I've been afraid I was going to become a pedophile. I've been afraid I was going to become a cannibal. I've been afraid I was going to kill my partner and keep their body. I've been afraid my affinity for foods with red sauce meant I was thirsting for human blood and flesh.

Regardless of the theme of the intrusive thoughts, many intrusive thoughts are or feel unspeakable. Because people associate OCD with symmetry and hand washing, most people miss the fact that OCD can involve incredibly tabboo and violent intrusive thoughts. Furthermore; OCD feels real. It feels real. Meaning, you FEEL like you actually do want to kill people. You feel like you actually are attracted to your sister even though you arent. A lot of people with OCD don't think they have it because it feels so real that if they accept its ocd, they might lose their hypervigilance and act on the thoughts. Because if they stop their compulsions, they believe that they will act on the thoughts. 

The stigma around mental health isn't just about personal hygeine or being late to work. Sometimes, people are afraid they're gonna fuck their dog and when they talk about it, everyone freaks the fuck out and doesn't look for signs of OCD. 

Most people with OCD don't realize they have it. So, when they're overwhelmed with these incredibly horrifying thoughts, they might seek online support. They might make posts like ""I'm afraid I'm going to lose control of my homicidal urges."" ""Am I attracted to my sister?"" ""I'm worried I'm a pedophile""

But as someone with ocd, I read these posts and very clearly see the other ocd symptoms attached to these fears. What do other people see? They see rapists, murderers, pedophiles, paraphiliacs. Even though these posts tend to involve details like ""I've never hurt anyone."" ""I'm too scared to hurt anyone."" ""I've never touched anyone.""

Still, the comments treat them like filth. Like criminals. And that's part of the problem.

When I tried to reach out about my Harm ocd when I was 14, my counselor freaked out when I told her about my thoights and started screening me for ASPD. I know someone who was falsely diagnosed with ASPD when they actually had harm ocd and it fucked them up for years. People with OCD do not want to act on these thoughts. These thoughts go against their identity and core values. These thoughts scare them even if they feel so real, even if they feel like they are choosing to think them.

People with Harm ocd or sexual assault themed ocd are some of the least likely people to commit these acts. They are constantly engaging in compulsions to prevent it, and they DONT want these things to happen. (Ie I used to tie my ankle to my bed post at night so I wouldn't kill anyone. I used to not go to school so I wouldn't lunge out at anyone. I used to not pet my cat because I didn't want to kill him. I used to avoid hugging my sister because I thought it meant I was attracted to her... even though I'm gay and also ew???. I never baby sat my cousins because I was afraid I wanted to hurt them or abuse them.)

I encourage people to consider ocd. When you see these ""scary"" or ""disgusting"" posts, look out for characteristics of ocd. Anecdotal evidence but I guarantee, 9/10 times what these people are describing is undiagnosed ocd, obsessional thinking, and intrusive thoughts. They just don't have the vocabulary. Instead of saying ""I have intrusive thoughts about hurting someone I love."" They say ""I keep having homicidal urges. How can I stop them?""

Sometimes, people need compassion even if what they're saying is shocking and you couldn't imagine having the same fears or thoughts. Instead of mocking them or treating them like monsters, look for OCD. Often times when people with undiagnosed ocd reach out for help, they're not going to have the vocabulary to confirm to viewers/readers that what they're experiencing is intrusive thoughts and obsessional fear. They're going to describe something scary because it's something that scares them and its what they're experiencing. 

Ending mental health stigma doesn't stop at forgiving people for not showering. It's also looking deeper when someone says ""what if I choke my cat."" ""What if I molest someone.""

Because believe it or not, people can think things and not want them to happen. In fact sometimes people's thoughts can be their greatest fears. OCD is egodystonic, meaning it specifically latches on to your values and exposes you to the opposite. 

Before you call someone a psychopath, consider ocd.

At 8 months pregnant, an ambulance was called to me at a multi story car park at 3am. I couldn‚Äôt do it, not when there was only a few weeks to go, as much as I wanted to die, I figured I‚Äôd hang on just 4 more weeks until my baby was born, then I‚Äôd do it. 

This led to many services getting involved, social workers, specialist midwives, the crisis team, the home treatment team and even perinatal mental health specialists. I‚Äôm not going to go into detail about the home environment I was in, because it still pains me to this day, but it was heavily infested with rats, only one window to the whole place, but because I was heavily pregnant (suffering with carpal tunnel) and could no longer work (I‚Äôm self employed, no maternity leave/pay.) I was stuck there, In this dungeon, 8 months pregnant stuck in a dark hell hole I couldn‚Äôt go outside due to concealing my pregnancy, listening to rats chewing through the walls around me. I was so ready to die.

Then, my family tried to barge in, convinced that I had fallen into a horrible drug addiction or worse, was rotting away alone, I promised that I would see them the next day and tell them what was happening. They thought this was me being ready to open up, get help, when really it was me giving up. I had nothing left to lose, I planned on being dead soon anyway, and I missed them. During my pregnancy, because of me concealing it i had to miss seeing my mother in hospital after she was rushed in for emergency surgery, my family dog dying (I never got to say goodbye) and, the death of my aunty and her funeral. I figured if I was going to die soon, I wanted to spend my last bit of time with them. I was surrendering, the adoption plan was in place, my baby would have a good life.

My family were supportive, as I knew they would be. Many services presumed my reason for hiding the pregnancy from them was out of fear, but it was the opposite. I‚Äôm lucky to come from a loving wealthy family who I didn‚Äôt want to change my mind. I wanted to die. 

My family begged me not to go through with the adoption, my mother offering to take full custody of my baby if I tried motherhood and didn‚Äôt like it. I wanted them to be happy, I thought he could be my replacement when I was gone, that he‚Äôd keep them busy and take some weight off their grief of losing me. I agreed, my mother got me to move back in with her, and I enjoyed the luxuries of sleeping at night not worrying about rats crawling over me and having access to hot water again. 

12 days after I told my family I was pregnant, my beautiful baby boy was born, 3 weeks early. From the second I first held him, he was my boy, and he wasn‚Äôt going anywhere.

From the moment he was here, it‚Äôs like my mental illness has been an awful boot camp that I‚Äôve finally graduated. Like all my suffering is now worth something. 

As you‚Äôll know, BPD amplified all emotions, I feel everything so intensely my emotions are like a physical sensation. In the past, this has caused me so much pain and heartbreak, until the second I first held my son, and the feeling of maternal love flooded me with the most intense, incredible feeling i could ever imagine. Something I never imagined I could feel, that I thought I was too fucked up to experience, came to me so naturally. And now I have a little human who I can love as much as I want and it doesn‚Äôt aggravate him. I‚Äôm never ‚Äòtoo much‚Äô for him, because he needs me and depends on me fully. How can I possibly be suicidal anymore when I have my baby who will always need me?

All those nights I‚Äôve spent awake all hours in tears, seem like preparation for the sleepless nights of having a newborn (,minus the tears!) 

My baby has become my fixation, and the best part? He wants all of my love, he doesn‚Äôt want space from me. And I‚Äôm never alone anymore. I have somebody to be strong for. Do I still feel like shit sometimes? Absolutely. But I don‚Äôt get the chance to feel like shit for too long, cause my baby keeps me busy! My overthinking myself into depressive episodes? Don‚Äôt have the time anymore, my boy needs me.

I never imagined being a mother, and I never imagined getting better.. which I‚Äôm still not fully. But I‚Äôm the best I‚Äôve been in years, and for the first time in a truly long time, I‚Äôm no longer suicidal. I want to be here, I want to care for my son, make sure he‚Äôs so loved that he‚Äôll never feel unwanted like I have. And with him around, I can‚Äôt imagine feeling unwanted for a long time (until he‚Äôs old enough for me to be embarrassing!)

It‚Äôs like all the love that I‚Äôve had to give finally has a place to go. I‚Äôm so happy. I look at him and I just want to do right by him, to be the best mother I can be. 

2 months ago I was 8 months pregnant, isolated from everybody, in a dark rat infested flat, planning on ending my life.

Now, I‚Äôm currently led on my big comfy double bed, watching my 6 week old baby sleeping peacefully beside me in his Moses basket, in a nice light clean house, smiling to myself and making plans for our future. 

I always rolled my eyes when people told me it gets better. I‚Äôd suffered over a decade of things just getting worse, until this year, I‚Äôd finally hit rock bottom. 

Now I‚Äôm on top of the world. I‚Äôve never been happier than I have being a mother. It‚Äôs been so long since I‚Äôve truly enjoyed being alive. 

This turned into a huge essay, but I don‚Äôt like sharing this too much IRL because of the shame and embarrassment of living in such poor conditions, the state my mental health had got to, and also now that he‚Äôs here... it breaks my heart to think I ever even considered adoption.

I‚Äôve been heavily and closely monitored by many services, and in the 6 weeks since his birth, I‚Äôve been discharged by 4, and have reduced visits from daily to fortnightly/monthly by all of them. They all tell me how amazing I‚Äôm doing at being a mother, and how in their professions it‚Äôs so nice to see a happy ending. I feel like I‚Äôm finally good enough at something, and that‚Äôs being his mummy.

Sorry to go on, I just wanted to share my story and hopefully inspire others that sometimes things do get better. Maybe your turnaround will be nothing like mine, and I‚Äôm not at all suggesting having a baby will cure your mental illness, but for me, this is finally me coming out of the other side. 

I‚Äôm finally happy. At 22 years old and a decade of diagnosed mental health problems, I don‚Äôt want to die anymore.",https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/dernuk/i_no_longer_want_to_die/,I no longer want to die.,,326,20,0.98

I work a full-time job, with benefits. Financially, I'm not rich, but I'm not poor.

There are a few providers in town that I think I would feel really comfortable with, but they are not covered under my insurance and I cannot afford to pay out of pocket. I make enough that I don't qualify for sliding scale, but not enough to actually pay the full rates.

This is ridiculous to me that, at this point in my life, I am more financially stable than I ever have been and quite frankly, pretty privileged in terms of money. Yet, I cannot get decent mental health care.

It was his friend in the therapist community (they shared a building where they held their practice out of) saying that he had unexpectedly passed away in his sleep for unknown reasons on Saturday. I'm in shock. Im devastated. I've been crying off and on all day. He was someone truly great and helped shaped me and the way I tackle the traumatic experiences Ive had in my life. And the oddest thing about it is how I don't feel like I have a community to fall back on in this time. In most cases with friends and family (even coworkers) there are others who can share some of the impact of the death with you. But in this case I feel so alone. The relationship we had was obviously unique, as most are. I've shared the deepest, hardest and most formable years of my life as an adult with him and yet I knew very little about his personal life.

I'm socially maladjusted due to my upbringing, my parents didn't allow me to interact with other kids, so my social skills dwindled ever since. I have a lot of social anxiety, and can barely look people in the eyes. My posture is stiff, I can't smile, I'm paranoid that everyone hates me.

I've been messing up again. Not knowing what's going on with schools and if they will close them again or if they will just keep going until kids start dropping. I don't know if I'm really worried if I've been made to feel that way. I don't know because the people in power are less honest than my 6 year old.

He's six. He was just 1. My other is 4. But he was just born it feels like. I'm 41. AND MY KIDS ARE 6 AND 4. How much longer do I have where I will be mentally fit to care for them? Or will I just be the old ass cranky dad who forgot what it's like to feel the magic of being a child? I haven't yet but one day I will. Will I make a big enough impact in my sons lives then when I die they will miss me? Will they talk about me with pride? Or will it be all the ways I failed...I'm so scared to screw up being a father that it is crippling.

My father wasn't a father. He was there. He didn't beat me or hurt me or scream at me. For that he would have had to actually care I was alive. I haven't spoke to him in years and I don't see that ever changing. My mom. My mother. The most racist, horrible, mean, scorned and damaged person I have ever met. I love her but I don't ever want to see them again.

I'm white. My wife is black. We have two mixed boys. The world is so messed up. Will my boys be treated different? Will they be looked down on? Will they not get chances because of it? Or will someone hand them something just because they are mixed? Why in the hell do I worry about this? Will they get killed at school? Will I be able to save them if they are in danger?

How do I cook a fucking hamburger on the stove without it turning to shit? I can't even fix the damn toilet that keeps clogging because I was never shown how to be a man and I know the world is different and It might not be right but It feels that way. I have nothing to be proud of. What my kids and wife? How in the hell has she not left me yet? I'm the most annoying person you could meet. I started puking again. I can't handle this. I used to be skinny and fast and strong. Now my knees hurt. The other day I hurt my neck from STANDING UP? It hurt for three days. I feel like there is nothing useful in me anymore. I'm 41 and anything that mattered is gone. Now I only have jobs. I have a job to raise my children to be great humans who don't hate. I have to teach my wife how to prepare for when I die. I have to make sure everyone is okay and taken care of. So when I die they are okay.

So what about while I'm alive? I get that I don't matter in the long run. My children do. But I am sick of being here. On Earth. I'm scared. I'm mentally alone. I make myself feel this way and I don't know why. I just want a life I can't have. I try to make things like they were...like all the horrid holidays when I was a child I try to make so beyond special for my kids that I've spoiled them and now nothing means anything.

I just want to feel like I'm wanted again. Not needed. I wish I had a friend. But I'm terrified of people. I can't even order at a drive thru without going into a minor panic attack and ordering too much. I'm starting to mentally crack at the smallest things. I don't yell or scream. I go sit in the garage and cry. So no one knows it. So when someone askes me why I'm sad and I explain it, they can't follow up with ""well what you need to do is"" ""or you shouldn't feel"". No shit. I'm not doing it for attention and I didn't say it was rational but I'm a grown ass man and I should not feel like this. I should not feel like I only matter because of ""responsibilities"". I just want someone to have a better day just because I am in their life. Why is it so wrong to want to feel good about something? To be noticed. For something besides ""can I have a snack"". Or because 99% of every decision that has to be made has to be made by me or it doesn't get made. I'm stretched too thin. I'm not superman. I can't do it all. I can't always make a decision. I'm human. And right now, I'm scared. And I'm not dealing with it okay. I knew that when I started to puke after I eat. There is this spot in the back and side of my mouth that if I tap with a straw I can empty my stomach in 10 seconds. So now I eat once a day. And I notice that my belly stays now. My whole life I could never gain a pound. 140 was the most I ever got. Then I was 160. And my stomach was gone. Now it was bigger. I was short of breath. My hair is gray in spots. I'm getting older. I'm already old. And one day I'll die. And idk what that is either. But I know that it doesn't matter what good I do, what will matter the most is what I wasn't able to do. The areas where I failed. Because no one is perfect. So I am going to fail. And that is the one thing I cannot afford to do.

I'm not asking for a pity party. I'm not asking for a damn thing. I just needed this out. But I will say that being a man makes this harder. Men are treated different when they talk about mental health. If I could just man up I would. And I do. Every damn day I man up. I do my job. I take care of my family and I'm damn good at it. But sometimes, it all comes in at me. Sometimes I get a chance to sit and think. And that is scary. I live my life on autopilot. When I stop to think is when it's bad.

I don't know any of you but I hope you are all happy. We live in an age where it's almost comical for people say they just want to be happy. But it's not. There is nothing wrong with wanting to be loved. Or wanted to be noticed.

 T√§pi had a tumour and died at 3 years old. My mum was the only one to even acknowledge that I had the right to be sad but others were literally saying ""it's just a guinea pig, it's not like a dog or anything so it doesn't matter"".

I was really depressed after that and since he died in his sleep I got this habit where I have to check every 10 minutes if Triibu is moving. Their cage is in my room.

2 days ago I wole up in the morning and went to check on him but he wasn't moving. I rattled the cage cause even if he's sleeping he usually reacts to that.

He didn't.

I went downstairs and told my mum. I went outside. In a few minutes she came back and said he wasn't dead yet bus close to it and that I should go be with him. When I got there he was dead.

I couldn't even say goodbye.

And I had to dig the grave and bury him while everyone else was laughing and just chilling in the garden.

 And I can't sleep. And I'm sad. It's too quiet in my room, and all the noises are wrong.

Today my mum's been yelling at me all day to clean the cage and take it out of my room but I can't even go near it without crying.

My parents had been married since 1979 when mom was 18 and dad was 22.
They have 4 sons ages 41, 40, 39, and 37 and then they have me a 17 yr old daughter. 

Today a neighbor stopped by to drop cookies off to my Dad and asked him out on a dinner date. Dad looked right at me and then told her ‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna have to get back to you on that one‚Äù 

Backstory on the neighbor: about a month after her husband died (like in 2016ish) she asked my Dad to come home with her one night from a bar party a bunch of the neighbors were at. Since then my Mom wasn‚Äôt a huge fan of the neighbor since she tried to convince my Dad to go home with her, and my Dad has avoided this woman like the plague because he wasn‚Äôt interested in anyone but my Mom and didn‚Äôt want to be asked again. I‚Äôve personally witnessed my Dad jog from his truck to the house so he wouldn‚Äôt run into the neighbor and have to talk to her.

My parents were that couple that were still so obviously in love after so many years that anyone around them could see how they felt about one another. 

I obviously want my Dad to be happy and I would never stop him from seeing someone, but am I wrong to not feel quite ready yet to see my Dad with another women 3 months after my Mom passed?

I have very low self-esteem and frequently deal with thoughts of not being good enough and feeling like people wouldn't miss me if I wasn't here. When people give me reasons to believe those thoughts, it fucks me up.

When my mom didn't call me on my birthday, I spent the whole day depressed because I thought she didn't care enough to remember.

When my family dog had to be put down suddenly, I was the last one to be told, and had it not been for my brother convincing my dad to call me, I wouldn't have known until the next morning, when she would've already been dead for hours. 

My dad got a new dog yesterday, which I again wasn't told until everyone else had known for a while. He didn't even tell me, my brother accidentally let it slip after they'd been to see it and was asked if they wanted to take her home with them for a few hours as a trial run. 

To anyone else, these would be things easily shrugged off, but they really get to me. Family is supposed to be the people who will want to be around you no matter what, yet I feel they try to avoid me and it sucks. On top of that, when I get emotional over these things, I get told I need to get my shit together and stop being to overdramatic. 

I talked to my brother about the dog-incident, and he told me to stop being so dramatic, and that this wasn't a big deal. To him it wasn't, to me it is. This argument has me in fucking tears cause I'm a mess.

My whole life I've been told my feelings are too much. I was the quiet, shy kid, and was never the one to get attention. However, when I was bullied at school and at home, and developed anxiety, I tried my best to get attention the only way I knew how, pretending to be sick. After the teachers caught on that I was faking, they eventually stopped caring, and let me walk around the school yard crying. It took me so long to realize I was crying because I was extremely anxious and was begging for help. 

Now, having been told my entire life that I'm just overreacting, that's also how I speak to myself. I'll have a literal panic attack, and the only thought in my head is that I'm faking. I still don't actually believe my panic attacks are real, even though the symptoms match up perfectly, but my brain will never give me the benefit of the doubt.

Therapy is not available and people would say I'm making excuses for being lazy/stupid if I tell them about my mental health issues. Since I was a kid, I've always been someone who is emotional, easily triggered, easily stressed out, and tends to overthink. Everyone, even my parents, sees me as ""weak, oversensitive, and dramatic"". They don't believe one can be struggling mentally when they look just fine and ""normal"" physically. There were some critical points in my life when I got panic attacks and cried everyday, I couldn't eat or sleep and was losing weight but my parents were totally helpless (and clueless) because I didn't seem to be sick anywhere looking from the outside.

I don't blame my parents for neglecting my mental health though. They live in such conservative society and had a hard time making ends meet, so I doubt they even have time to learn about something so foreign to them. I blame the whole ""cultural stigma"" in general. I feel like a misfit. I just wish I could get out of this prejudiced place asap, move to a different country where mental health is prioritized, where people understand me and I'm not considered ""crazy"".

Well my name is Miguel but my friends call me Mike, I am 23 guy that used to struggle with anxiety and depression until now, after a year with meds and therapies I can say I am depression/anxiety free! 

I had been dealing with it since my father passed away 4 years ago. 
Last year was a really rough for me, I was unable to go outside, going to the university even to clean myself, Everything was making scared I felt like it was no future for me. My notes were going down close to getting kick out of the university, lots of debts, No money incomes, sent tons of job applications and no answer, losing friends, weight,started with suicidal thoughs and close to getting suicidal tendencies, was hitting the bottom until I met my gf (current ex) a wonferful woman that helped me go through and push me over to see a specialist because I wanted to be better for me and for her. We are no longer together but thanks to her I am better now, I don't know what could happened if I didn't meet her, I will be forever thankful to her. 

Took me a year to seen my potential and what I was capable, Also to love myself again. Was a difficult journey I will not lie but trust me, it is really worthy.

gmstop,therapy,1589908602.0,"So I had my first ever therapy session today. It was quite in the beginning, after I held a 10 minute  monologue about why I am actually there. I then stopped to take a breath. I was also really nervous and sweating, and my mouth was dry. She recognized that I was a bit overwhelmed by the whole situation. She said that it is quite a lot indeed. I then asked her if she has some water, and well, she replied by asking whether water has some kind of meaning to me, or what I relate to it.

I was so confused.

In my perplexed state I answered that I actually just have a dry mouth and am a bit thirsty.   
She just looked at me with expectant, analytical eyes and nodded slightly without saying anything. 

I was even more confused.

So I just went like ""Uhmm. Ok. Alright so my childhood.."" and continued my monologue. Without water.

For the rest of the session she actually seemed nice and normal and sane, and I also didn't mention the water thing anymore. But I just can't stop wondering about what was going on in her head when I asked that water question. Is there some psychological concept related to needing water? Is it abnormal to ask for water in a therapy session? Do therapists always interpret a deeper psychological meaning behind everything you say or do? It's my fist time being in a therapy session and I really don't know what to expect, what's normal and what isn't.

I had so much respect for the man and the rapport between us was something I'd never felt before. I was so comfortable around him and could discuss anything I needed to. He was the first therapist to correctly diagnose me with Bipolar II. He listened, he cared, and during your session you were his main priority. We had discussed going to 1 session every 2 weeks in the new year due to my progression. That progression would never have happened without his support and compassion. He will always have a place in my heart and I know that with the tools he gave me, I'll be able to continue my progression.

I have no idea how to mourn (even though I‚Äôve lost people in the past) and especially not for someone who helped me through my life every week for the past year.

koycbz,mentalhealth,1609597833.0,"hey um.. I recently found out about this ""disorder"" (i put it in quotes because it is not actually recognized by the DSM)

It is when people daydream very extensively for sometimes hours a day. They create their own highly structured universes and scenarios that help them cope with drama etc.

They often have the urge to that as soon as they wake up. Also while doing that a lot of people engage on repetitive movement (like pacing around). I have heard that psychologists suspect that it activates certain areas in the brain that control your imagination or might effect it in a hypnotic way (((excuse my wording i am not a native speaker lol)))

Those people do NOT gaslight themself. In fact most of MDers are able to tell which of their memories are within their paracosm/imagination and which are not.

Effects of this intense daydreaming is that people with that ""disorder"" sometimes find it very hard to focus on ANYTHING.

Some people argue that daydreaming is natural and MD should not be regarded as a mental illness. I think it certainly has characteristics of a mental illness. It is a coping mechanism at the beginning but at some point MDers find themself daydreaming all day because they got so used to living in this paracosm that they don¬¥t enjoy reality as much anymore. And this is an endless circle. Because if you don¬¥t do stuff with other people or your friends, and avoid your responsibilities and flee in your paracosm your live will get more miserable and your imagined friends, scenarios and word will look more and more appealing.

I recently found out that i might have this ""disorder"". I have stumbled across this because I had problems with not being able to live in the present. A lot of my scenarios are about my future and they are often highly fantastical. So instead of actually doing stuff that might bring me to a future that i might enjoy i just dream about already being there.

Since then i am always searching for new information on this subject and one researcher that does amazing work within this field is Eli Somer. He was the first one who recognized it and publishes a lot of videos about MD on youtube.

Here is his channel: [https://www.youtube.com/user/SomerClinic](https://www.youtube.com/user/SomerClinic)

If you have any thoughts, or further research sources please drop them here. And especially if you have experience with this subject first hand.

People I‚Äôve loved have weaved in and out of those rooms without thought in search of a place to call home, and here I am staring at the worn paint and marks along the walls from memories of beer pong, twister, and indoor dodgeball amongst other absurd things, wondering where the time went and if I‚Äôll ever feel family like I have over the several years I‚Äôve built and nurtured my circle.

If you were abused, hurt, ripped apart by their words or even physically injured by those so-called grown-ups in your childhood, **it is absolutely and categorically not your fault**. And it is not your job to fix it. It's not your job now and it wasn't your job then. You had no control over their actions and no responsibility for them. They had the responsibility to care for you and they messed it up big time. You did not ask to be born into the situation you were born into. You were a vulnerable child whose needs, for some reason or another, were not fully met. And that rests entirely with the adults, not with you. A child can never be blamed for that.

Also, **you owe them nothing**. They may have fed you and put a roof over your head, but if they otherwise treated you like shit, or still do treat you like shit, walk away and don't look back.

I just got my Top Of The Morning candle and hot chocolate in the mail, so my room smells like coffee with vanilla scent...and I feel a little better than I had before. The urge to cut has lessened a LOT, thanks to my Reddit family. :)

<3 As I said, I am forever grateful to all of you! <3

9xnkc5,mentalhealth,1542385039.0,"My fianc√© walked out on me last night out of nowhere. We‚Äôve always had an amazing, strong relationship, or so I thought. I was putting dinner on his plate, a normal evening, until he mentioned he didn‚Äôt want much because his stomachs been upset and he can‚Äôt eat. When I asked why... that‚Äôs when my world ended. We have been together for 11 years, engaged for only 4 months. For the last 5 years, I‚Äôve been living with terminal cancer and he‚Äôs been my rock. My mental health has been very touchy as one can imagine having incurable cancer and he‚Äôs been the one thing keeping me here and fighting. I actually did a clinical trial that surprisingly helped me. We‚Äôre just getting to a place with my health where maybe I can live a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù life. We‚Äôre supposed to be leaving on vacation in a few weeks and finally got to a point where we can plan things for the future. Theres so much coming up. I‚Äôve been improving myself and my mental health A LOT. He says he sees these improvements and they should make him happy, but it doesn‚Äôt. He told me when I just had my scans, he should‚Äôve felt something, but he didn‚Äôt. He‚Äôs lost his compassion for me and isn‚Äôt in love with me anymore. I supported him through school and now that he‚Äôs done, he‚Äôs not only my emotional, but my financial rock, as well as helping me with things my disability makes hard. I don‚Äôt have much family and I lost a lot of people when I was diagnosed with cancer. He threw in my face that he wants children and I can‚Äôt provide that (this isn‚Äôt anything new) and when I said I was getting to a point in my health where I could start looking into options for how to have kids he said, ‚Äúeven if we could, is it smart to bring a child into this world not knowing if they‚Äôll have a mom around?‚Äù Not being able to have kids has been one of the hardest things that i struggle with, and he knows that and always reassured me that I was more important. I didn‚Äôt even know this person talking to me. So cold, empty. I feel so hurt because many times at the beginning of my diagnosis, I told him to leave me so that I didn‚Äôt have to drag him into this life and he always promised me he wouldn‚Äôt have it any other way. He told me he‚Äôs not happy with his life and his priorities have changed and he doesn‚Äôt want to resent me. We never even argued. We were the couple people looked up to and my life collapsed around me in a matter of seconds. I‚Äôm having to tell people today and they‚Äôre not even believing it. Everything was perfect and then everything was gone. I don‚Äôt know how to live without him. I don‚Äôt even know how I can make this work. I‚Äôm so hurt and angry. Why propose mere months ago after 10 years just for this to happen? How can you just leave as things were getting okay and after I had everything in my life already ripped away with cancer and was trying to figure out how to rebuild and finally have a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù life? I haven‚Äôt slept, I can‚Äôt eat. I‚Äôm scared of what I might do when reality sets in. I‚Äôm going to die alone. Nobody wants to be with the amputee with cancer and I‚Äôm devastated. My self esteem has never been lower. I can‚Äôt have kids. I‚Äôm going to die alone. And a part of me wishes my cancer was bad again and it would take me sooner so I don‚Äôt have to do this anymore. I‚Äôm so over these cards I‚Äôve been dealt. I had a 20% chance of still being alive in March, and he won‚Äôt be there by my side.

To start with some background, I suffer from anxiety and depression, and I‚Äôm in recovery for anorexia (have been for 1 1/2 years). This semester is one of my hardest ones, as I‚Äôm taking 16 credit hours in 8 weeks, and it‚Äôs made me incredibly anxious, and has made my eating disorder come back into play. I feel like I‚Äôm dying because of the weight loss and my heart pounding at all times of the day. 

My cousin got into an extremely bad car accident two weeks ago, and she‚Äôs in a coma, had broken her neck and jaw, and the doctors are extremely pessimistic about her recovering. They believe that IF she wakes up, she‚Äôll be a vegetable. This is my favourite cousin; she‚Äôs so hardworking, caring, and compassionate, and she has three kiddos all under age 5. Their dad is not in the picture, so they‚Äôve been bouncing from relative to relative, and they‚Äôre at my house currently. I‚Äôm 24, in graduate school, and have no kids of my own, so this alone has flipped my world upside down. 

Last night, I got a call from my mom that my grandfather is on hospice, and will likely pass away either this weekend or early next week. I have to figure out how I‚Äôm going to get to the funeral with the kids, manage my school work (I have two exams this weekend and finals are next week), and have to find someone to cover my shifts while I travel for the funeral. 

I just feel defeated. All of my hard work to get my anxiety and eating under control feels like it‚Äôs completely for nothing.

I've had a meth addiction for quite some time now. A few hours ago, I ended up buying some fake shit. Looked completely legit but wasn't. I had a fire in my stomach that hurt so bad I started bawling. I went to message the dude on my Facebook and found out he blocked me. So I sat there for about 5 minutes seething with rage. This is definitely not the first time this had happened. Suddenly, I started laughing. Not just giggling, but full blown hysterical howls of laughter. 

How stupid was I for allowing myself to get ripped off after several times of it happening?? I could have done something useful with that money. So I just shook my head, smiling, and got onto another Facebook account and messaged him. I simply said ""We both know what you did, and it's alright. Karma will take care of it. Peace.""

I put my phone down and immediately got up,, put my meth pipe on the floor, and stomped it, shattering it.

The moment I said ""Well you guys always say I should leave the room and go somewhere so I am now."" they immediately invited me to a talk in the living room about if I'm going out to meet someone or if there's something they should know or if I'm alright. Nope. nah. I'm good. Just... leaving... to wal-mart... yeah cuz everywhere else is closed now... no I'm alright...

I ended up inviting my brother cuz he also sits in bed all day and my Dad suggested it and me and my brother are really chill with each other. Eventually they're like ""Ok, I mean we're not stopping you, so... if there's anything you need to tell us, yknow-"" and me and my brother are out. Finally. It felt like rolling a 2 on a d20 but still succeeding (which I guess implies this was hard to screw up, but oh well)

Now the good part, we DID end up going to walmart. You may be wondering why in ALL of the places walmart? Well, I don't know a lot of places that aren't stores or places where you can walk in without some expectation of you spending money there (I mean, why else do people build buildings, eh?) My original plan was to go to the library but fun fact about the library: It just so happens on Thursdays and only Thursdays they close at 6PM instead of 9PM. And I was leaving the house later than I had initially planned to, since I spent so much time preparing and working up the nerve to tell my parents. Also we live in the middle of frick-off nowhere, and Walmart and the library are like 10-15 minute drives away from my home. There weren't many options, I tell you. (btw I found out I live there because my parents didn't want neighbors and liked the peace and quiet, which explains why we live at the end of a dead-end street and why I grew up very sheltered and very asocial.)

Walmart was fun. Especially since my brother is really into old stuff that we used to always be hyped about like nerf guns and lego. I told him I don't have anything to pay off so let's buy useless stuff, and we did. Checkout line was long as usual. No one was wearing a mask, as usual. I then remembered that Dunkin' Donuts closes at 9PM and it was almost 8, so I asked him if he wanted a donut since we have time. This is a weird bit that's unimportant to the story, but I want to bring it up anyway. We get there (literally across the street from Walmart) and we reach the doors. The employees see us, and just... leave. One dude literally tried to stand behind the computer so we wouldn't see him, even after rattling the door that has the hours printed on them. Ok... you guys just... not want anyone in here..? We end up leaving, donut-less and heartbroken... but oh well, at least I had made the effort to drive out, which I guess was the whole point.

The cool thing after that is that my parents seemed fairly cool about the situation afterword when I got home. I guess they had time to think it over while we were out as opposed to me appearing suddenly in proper clothes all like ""ah yes I've decided to go *outside* today!"" They treated me as if I had just came back from work, or turning in some checks at the bank. Just ""so what'd you guys do? Oh, cool cool"" you get the idea. My mom also looked up reviews on that dunkin' and apparently it has a reputation for bad service and willful ignorance, so ok I guess.

So, that was sure an experience that felt awkward and painful at the start, but *hopefully* I can just force it into becoming a normal thing. I plan on going to the Library next, probably by myself this time. Just to do some sketching and checking out some drawing guides and good reads. Then, they'll have no choice but to let me go back when I have to return the books. I'm telling you guys, it's the perfect plan. I'm only concerned with how my parents think about me now. They really, truly sounded concerned about me earlier, but bro I'm just trying to *do things* that normal people do everyday.

a7rcjd,mentalhealth,1545258516.0,"This is a HUGE deal for me. I'm 26 and during my entire life, my parents have yelled and screamed that mental health, more specifically anxiety and depression, wasn't a real thing. They often dismiss anything that they don't want to accept, anything that might be a real issue. I wasn't allowed to go to a therapist, even when the school counselor brought me in almost weekly (mostly in middle school) to talk about well, anything. They were just trying to get something out of me but I often thought I was in trouble and didn't really understand why I kept getting taken out of class. 

So I've been struggling with my demons my entire life, looking for ways to cope, most of the time it was through drugs/alcohol, but I've cut down on that a lot. A close friend of mine has repeatedly told me over and over that I need to go talk to a therapist, and he's tried to convince me that I'm not crazy because I need help. Over and over and over again I told him that I didn't need to, I was fine, I just need to vent sometimes. I guess though, after my last episode a couple days ago, I was going on and on about how I just wasted my whole life, how I keep wasting time, how I don't have a direction, how I'm afraid to leave, how I'm afraid to act on things, how I'm indecisive, etcetcetc and he just flat out told me again that I really really need to seek someone out and it's not because he didn't want to help, he just doesn't know how to get to the root of my problem.

After some extensive research, I found a really nice counseling office right by my house. The counselor has a therapy dog too! My first appointment is on January 2, right after I get out of work.

mr0i52,mentalhealth,1618435784.0,"(Just to preface I have BPD and also mild OCD)

A 16 year old boy was murdered by his 'friends' 9 years ago. To this day, I still cry over it, even when everyone else has forgotten about him.

I don't know why, but this death always makes me feel IMMENSELY sad whenever I think about it. It was in Winter, the 16 year old boy was having some kind of night out with his friends. I'm not sure how long he'd known these friends, but he was seen at at a McDonald's with these friends, and wasn't seen alive again. The boy was reported as missing and a search was underway. Early the next morning, he was found in his car in the middle of nowhere, dead and half-frozen. He'd been choked to death and from what I recall it was quite violent as bruises were repeatedly mentioned.

The suspects were never charged due to insufficient evidence. None of the boy's belongings were taken and no motive was revealed. The case remains officially 'unsolved' to this day and from what I recall only one or two YouTube narrators ever mentioned the case with updates. It's like everyone just..forgot about him. His death didn't even get into the national news and it was only mentioned in a few papers.

I just think, it must've been so scary to be alone at night in the middle of nowhere with a group of three friends who seemed completely normal up until that point with him in the car with them, then they (for no apparent reason) turned on him and killed him. That's like a living nightmare. Then to add insult to injury the suspects were never charged so the kid (and his girlfriend) doesn't even have any closure.

This case kind of makes me want ghosts/spirits to not be real, because if his ghost/spirit is still wandering around, I feel like your murderers getting away with murder would be absolute torture and you still don't know why they just killed you out of the blue in a really painful slow way. If that happened to me I think I'd have a massive mental breakdown in my mind as I died.

I wish there just could have been someone walking by so they could've saved him. Then he'd still be alive.

He'd be 25 years old now. Sometimes I get reminded of his death and I cry. I imagine the terror he went through and the fear, the hopelessness, the terrified look on his face, the feeling of betrayal, how it was all dark/alone in that car, everything. For some reason he tends to come up in my dreams a lot, like I'll dream that it comes up in the newspaper that he made some miraculous recovery in the hospital, and he awoke from a coma and he's still alive. I get excited and happy, then I wake up and realize it's just a dream and he's gone.

I keep feeling his sadness, and thoughts running through his head like ''why are you doing this to me'' or ''they're killing me and nobody's around to help'' and ''is this a nightmare''. Recently I saw a video of what a body looks like at various days/years after death and by now his clothes would look all torn and he'd be mostly bones by now. I had to stop the video because it made me think about him in that state and I cried for hours. I imagine him bleeding from his eyes, nose and mouth before he died and it makes me cry.

If I ever travel to the town/state he died in, I'd make it a point to get some flowers for him and leave them at his grave.

fzntlv,therapy,1586656436.0,"So, recently I saw a very very disturbing trend in the r/PTSD sub.

Many many people use their PTSD as an excuse to lash out at their beloved ones.

Your mental illness is not an excuse for being hurtful to others.

Of course, it is not that easy to determine. Sometimes, there is this thing called re-actional anger. So, it is possible that you get angry as a defensive mechanism and people are actually the one abusing you.

It is never that simple!

That being said, more often that not, I saw that this is not the case! I saw that the people lashing out did it without being provoked, but simply to make themselves feel better.

Especially, if the person you are lashing out is a child. Yeah, I saw that, too. People lashing out at their younger siblings and using their mental illness as an excuse.

Your mental illness is not a free pass for abuse. We are all suffering here, do not turn on your beloved ones!!!

I have zero empathy for people like that.

EDIT: Wow, thank you for the support. I felt so so shitty from all this.

Also, for those who tell me stuff that I have cognitive dissonance or I am the same.

So, me having the ability to differentiate friend from foe is a cognitive dissonance, but the lack of this ability is normal. hahaha aight

As for me, being the same. Ha... you know, when I feel shitty and triggered, what I do, I go and volunteer, I extend a hand, I try to support others. Helping makes me feel better. I try to follow the path of the wounded healer, of bodhisatva. As long as there are suffering soul, I will try and be there. I will be where the pain is. Help others to heal, and you will help yourself. I have volunteered in a poor school, despite the fact children were huge trigger for me. Every time I looked into the face of  one particular young boy,  who liked me very much, I was back there, with the pedophile in kindergarten. So, the excuse that the child reminds you of your abuser, I know all too well. I did not hurt that child, I protected him, and I saw the glow in his eyes. I transformed my pain and supported him through his. All of them just spiraled me back than, really. So, I focused harder to make a safe spot for them, away from the physical abuse, they were getting, away from neglect, from childhood labor. I got a lot of abuse myself. The other teachers were horrifying, and at the end, I just cracked and left. I was really dissociated. I cried so much for those children. That's only one example. I don't care about my pain, though. I helped those children. I have saved lives from suicide, too. I remember that convo with that ex-cop, I had. Man, he was ready to shoot himself. I am ready to kill and to die for my allies, not to mistake them for my enemies. I know who those are. Oh, I do. My love is for my allies, my hate for my enemies. Is it cognitive dissonance having a moral compass and supporting your people? I don't think so. I am supportive, and I am nurturing. I know that. I have zero empathy for the abusers. No forgiveness or support to them. I am not like you! I am not like you people at all.

For all of the rest of you, who are fighting the good fight, and you were there for me. This meant a lot! I do a lot of good, but actually I have a very fragile confidence and I am in desperate need for support. To the point that people totally take advantage of me and hurt me a lot. You empower me to go there and help more people. Thank you, I appreciate you all. All the best to you!

EDIT2: I was censored in cPTSD for hate speech. I am living this place for good, but I learned from this enablers something. Hate speech they say. haha sure, I am very hateful towards child abusers. I am hateful and angry and I have pointed those feelings at the right direction. And for that I got silenced.

It is crazy, but this is the world we are living in. This was a very toxic move, They sure showed me where they stand.  It is not only about the message ""Abuse is not an excuse for more abuse"". Oh, nooooo.... Not that. This could fly.

I go against the status quo too much and the status quo is anger is forbidden, and hate is absolutely forbidden. Those emotions are bad bad bad, and you are bad bad bad for having them, and you will be punished like a bad bad person. This is what abusers do to their victims to subdue them. They shun anger and they shun hate, and they tell you are bad for expressing them, in order to have you under their control. This is the difference between a victim, and a survivor. The victim still believes that.

What I have observed thus far, the unspoken rules are this: Every expression of anger and hate should be let go and not felt, unless of course you are losing yourself in dissociative fugue, you hurt others without control, or you hurt yourself without control. The only time, I saw people having support with anger and hate, was when they were totally lost and suffering from it, which of course they will be, when the answer is suppressing it. When you suppress an emotion long enough, it will consume you.

I saw a lot of suppressed anger and hate in this sub.

I am not afraid of those feelings, I am human, I have them, and I own them. Those feelings are the difference between victim and a survivor.

Victims haven't owned them, and they still remember what it is like to live under the thumb of their abusers, of the times, where the abusers punished them for expressing anger, for expressing hate, for expressing basic survival instincts.

They still haven't understood that those feelings are vital for survival. And this is exactly what the fight instinct is. It is often suppressed in victims. I understand it now. Society runs on victims, it runs on trauma. It doesn't run on survivals.

I am a revolutionary just by saying to the abusers. "" I am enraged, I hate you"", but rationally and with control, not during episodes, without control.  I am calculated with my feelings, I try my best to control them, and not them me. But this can be done only with acceptance, not with suppression.

So, it's hate speech hating on abusers, and you get censored, but it is totally okay, if you decide to harm yourself in your confusion or to hurt those weaker than you.

And self-harm is exactly that, suppressed anger, and suppressed hate. I know. Been there, done that. I don't self-harm anymore. i am not angry at myself anymore, I don't hate myself anymore, I hate the people who hurt me. And damn that feels empowering! Those humans will never come close to me again! It is very healthy to love your allies, and hate your abusers. This is how you grow, this is how you thrive. Basic survival instincts.

But it is not trendy to be healthy. You will ruin a whole society, that is fueled by abuse and by suppression. We don't want angry slaves, we want obedient slaves. And anger and hate sure make a slave rebel. Stupid slave! Why you rebel! Know your place. Stop being angry. That's hate speech!

I remember this is what my lawyer told me, when I was planning my escape. Run and hide, because the system sides with the abusers, and no-one will help you. You don't have a chance.

This is the reality.

EDIT3: About righteous anger. I am very happy my friends do not enable my abusive behavior. I was abusive in my rampage. I lashed out at the moderators at AITA for thinking they censored me. They didn't. I was very wrong. They are very nice people and reacted quite kindly to my outburst. So, I am banned, righteously so! So, I made a mistake, and I own it. I will apologize once my ban is over. I am grateful for having friends, who are not afraid to call me out!

(3) almost 2 years later, I‚Äôm at a much better place and she knows that, too. We‚Äôve been seeing each other once a week without a fail. No doubt, she‚Äôs a great therapist and helped me immeasurably.

(4) In February of 2020, I get a job with health benefits and she tells me that she accepts my new insurance. I give her the info.

(5) 1 year and 3 months have passed since I‚Äôve given her the new insurance information.

(6) she calls me on Monday, saying that actually, it‚Äôs not the type of insurance she accepts (she accepts a different plan my health insurance company offers) and that she‚Äôs not gotten paid for a single session from February of 2020.

(7) she admits her fault and asks me to pay for Jan-April 2021 fees with discount (~$1000). She says that since it‚Äôs her fault, she‚Äôll regard last year‚Äôs work as pro-bono.

(8) I send her the money right after the call.

(9) she calls me again today, asks that I pay the co-pay I should‚Äôve paid even if she accepted the insurance (=$680 total).

I am going to pay her the $680 she asked for. She deserves that for she saved my life.

But she asked me to find another therapist and to not hurt myself because of this. Apologies, apologies, take care, goodbye.

i9rbbm,therapy,1597429397.0,"Over several months, my therapist had been working on confidence with me, and getting rid of the ‚Äútoxic confidence‚Äù because yes, being over confident can be dangerous to yourself, and others. She started out with, ‚Äútell yourself you‚Äôre better than somebody. Any name, doesn‚Äôt matter.‚Äù Several months ago I had said that I didn‚Äôt need to tell myself I was, because I knew it. Very toxic mindset. Today, she asked me the same question. She asked me how it felt to say I was better, and today I replied with ‚Äútoxic, demeaning, and an unfair comparison.‚Äù Months ago, I told her it felt empowering, freeing, like I struck fear and commanded attention, that nobody could cross me with this mindset. 
She nodded in agreement to my admittance that it was a toxic way of being. She then asked me to pick out a quality in myself that I thought appeared more attractive than on a person I could picture and name. Months ago, I could. I did. I said my rosie pink cheeks, with perfectly speckled freckles, my long hair, thin hourglass body, and my perfectly straight teeth and tan skin look better on me than (insert anonymous name, for privacy reasons)
Today? I couldn‚Äôt. 
She asked me why I couldn‚Äôt pick out a person I was in competition with, or something so obvious as my eyebrows, my makeup, my winged eyeliner, my body, my long hair and straight teeth, and I said the same thing as I did with the first question. It is toxic, it is demeaning, and it‚Äôs an unfair comparison because there should not be a comparison or competition. This is when it finally clicked. She broke the mindset of I‚Äôm perfect, you‚Äôre a peasant. We are all flawed. I have gained a few pounds, I now have braces, and I do not feel like it is fair now, or never at all to say that I am or was better than another. I had to learn the painful way that it isn‚Äôt until we lose control over our ‚Äúperfect appearance‚Äù that we feel shame in ourselves for what we look like to others. After years of self deprecating insults toward myself, toward others mentally, constantly comparing myself to other people and wanting to look like, sound like, and dress like other men and women or wanting them to look at me like I was a god they couldn‚Äôt match, she finally released the training harness on me and let me roam freely with my mind, with questions that she knew I couldn‚Äôt answer kindly 6 months ago. I cannot lie and say that I often times did feel as though I was better than a lot of people, by my vocal talent, my writing, my drawing, the way I dressed, and how perfectly I did my eyebrows and hair every morning. I‚Äôd often times let my false perception of perfection get to my head, without thinking of the damage it could be doing to others and how I treat them when I tell myself that I am superior. I am not, I have never been. 

She finished our session with this homework. 
When you feel ‚Äútoxic confidence‚Äù returning, tell yourself in private to say something about you that makes another person look inferior, and imagine that person knowing how you feel and picture them devastated by it. Now swap roles and picture you in their shoes. Realize how damaging your attitude may be. Alter it.  
Then proceeded to end with this quote:
Toxic is ‚ÄúI‚Äôm better than them.‚Äù 
Confidence is ‚ÄúI‚Äôm great, and so are they.‚Äù It sounds prettier, because it IS prettier to uplift and empower those around you to feel as good about themselves, as you do inside when you think you‚Äôre ‚Äúbetter.‚Äù You‚Äôre not better, simply alike in greatness with others.",https://www.reddit.com/r/therapy/comments/i9rbbm/my_therapist_taught_me_this_trick_when_i_think_im/,"My therapist taught me this trick, when I think I‚Äôm better than others.",,264,18,0.98

jstn7k,therapy,1605183539.0,"Is this acceptable behaviour for a therapist? 

Yesterday I told my therapist of 8 months that I would like to take a break from sessions. I had been feeling for a few weeks that I'm not getting much out of our time together. Prior to this she had always been helpful and insightful during each session. The sessions are eye-wateringly expensive, and as the UK has just been plunged into a second lockdown and I've lost a lot of work, finding the money for therapy has become much harder for me. Along with this, I also mentioned that I had started feeling ""too dependent"" on her- finding myself waiting for our session to roll around, not taking enough responsibility for my own mental state. I told her if I could afford to be in weekly therapy for the next 6 months, I would do it, as I believe it can work - but it's just not within my means to pay for something so expensive at the moment, especially given my progress has stalled.

She has said in the past that she recommends if people can't afford therapy, that they ""eat a bit less"" to raise the money, which always struck me as a bit odd - at ¬£430 a month, even if I stopped eating completely, it wouldn't begin to cover the cost!

Anyway, having said that, I did feel like she had at this point given me some great tools to go forth with, and I felt confident that I could cope with a period of not having sessions, and be OK. 

I told her all this, and what she said struck me as kind of ... off. She began by saying that if I stopped therapy now, I would essentially have no chance of getting better. That someone like me needs to be in therapy for at least a year, and that given that it wasn't the case that I ""literally can't afford it"", it was just an extra source of stress, me stopping now was in her opinion, a cop out. She said that all the things that are going well in my life at the moment because of therapy - my relationship with my parents, for example - are just in a honeymoon phase, and will certainly get worse if I stop sessions. She said my reasons for wanting to quit therapy were in completely in line with the core of my psychological issue (though she didn't describe what that actually is), that although I would immediately feel better if I stopped sessions (which I have to admit, has happened), sooner or later, my mental health would inevitably start to decline again.

Now, I'm no therapist, but if I had a client who began to struggle paying for sessions and needed a break, my instinct would be to build them up as much as I can, remind them to use their tools, remind them how much progress they have made, and tell them that they \*can\* get through this. Instead what I got was essentially a ""you can't do this without me"". 

The thing is... it didn't stop there! 

She went on to tell me how busy she was, how many clients she had that day (11 hours with no break), how many clients she had to turn away each week, and told me that personally, she would greatly benefit from me stopping sessions, as she would prefer to use the hour she spends with me writing her book instead. She told me that I should remember that she doesn't ""take me home with her"" - I'm just a spot in her diary. I listened quietly, having said nothing to which this would have been an appropriate response.

She also told me the reason she was late to our session was because she was reading an email from an anorexic client of hers, recently at death's door, saying how happy she was that she had spent the week eating freely and not obsessing about food. Again, I struggled to see the significance of her telling me this. I can only assume she was trying to demonstrate to me her skill as a therapist - something that ironically I had never questioned until this point. 

She told me that regardless of my struggle to pay her, my wish to take a break from therapy was a cop out. I asked her what the protocol normally was for ending with clients. See, I didn't tell her this, but a small factor in my deciding to take a break from therapy was because she has also been seeing a friend of mine also for a few years now - a friend who has recently struggling with her mental health more than can I ever remember. On the back of having had a few weeks where I felt like my therapist's input had not been new or insightful, seeing my friend in this state after such a long time made me feel like there's no guarantee that my mental health would continue to improve. What was for sure, though, is that I would continue to feel the pinch of living beyond my means.

My therapist offered me a reduction in fees, for which I was truly grateful. We talked about perhaps doing fortnightly sessions instead of weekly, and I asked whether I could go away and consider this before making a decision. She said - no problem, and remember - if you do take a break, you can come back and see me at any time.

Now - this is where things got weird. In the last two minutes of the session, having agreed that I would go away and think about it, something in her flipped. It's hard to say what exactly happened, but it felt to me as if she had made some sort of snap decision that I was no longer worth her time. 

I was explaining how the choice I have to make between paying my work-related costs and paying for therapy was causing me stress, when she abruptly cut in to say - ""You're right. You do need to stop therapy. Your thought processes are frankly ridiculous, I can't get seem to get through to you. I know this is abrupt, but I can see you're in some sort of ""zone"" here, and this is pointless, so... Good luck."" And then she ended our session, and hung up. 

Her tone was impatient, irritable - not her usual therapy voice. I'm ok and I can take it, but honestly it was really jarring, especially considering that she had just spent the whole session assuring me of the bad things that would certainly befall me if I were to stop therapy.

I respect her for not agreeing with me. I respect her clinical assessment in telling me I'm not ready. But telling me taking a break is a cop out because I'm not completely broke? Telling me that she'd be glad if I left because she'd rather be writing her book? Telling me that my thinking is ridiculous, (having previously said my thinking was ""crazy""), without saying why? Well, it was all a bit of a shock. I have always felt so lucky to have had a good therapist. Seeing her flail like that in her final hour has made question her, and the whole process. 

Beneath my indignation at all this, I can feel that I‚Äôve been left feeling hurt and disorientated. Part of me wonders whether that was intentional on her part - she has stressed in the past how smart she is, and how good she is at her job. Was this just a slip-up?

Either way, I stand behind my decision. If I had to point to one main reason why I quit, I would say it was because the few times I expressed how powerless I felt in the therapy, she said ""You're not supposed to have the power. You're not the therapist, I am. The process is in my hands"". 

And that, to me, just made no sense.

me: ""uhhh, no, no I haven't.""

therapist: ""why haven't you dated girls?""

me: ""because I'm not attracted to them like that?"" I'm only interested in men.

On Saturday during my video session (because pandemic) she told me that she‚Äôs noticed a huge shift in me the last couple sessions and that it showed through a lot in this session. 

She said she can tell that I am really learning to put up boundaries and that I am beginning to really see my own self worth and that I am really learning to become, unapologetically me. 

I cried. I cried because of the session and the stuff being brought up and discussed, but then I cried happy tears because someone other than my friends sees this change in me.

Hi r/therapy. I'm reeling from something that happened within my family and I don't feel comfortable speaking with friends about it, or even my therapist just yet. Verbally discussing it is just too hard right now, and I'm hoping to use this as a safe space to talk through what I'm going through. Please refer to trigger warning content above before proceeding.

This morning my father received a phone call regarding my grandmother. She currently lives out-of-state in an assisted living setup, but in a regular home versus a large facility. Due to the way her insurance works, she had to be placed somewhere in the state where she had worked prior to retiring, so she was unable to stay with us. She also is in the later stages of alzheimers disease, which my family is unequipped to care for. My father did extensive research, and chose her current residence due to the high reviews and the environment, which seemed less ""sterile"" than larger facilities. She has been living at this place for 8 years without a hitch, and has seemingly had good care throughout the time that's she been there. We and other family members have visited several times and nothing has ever seemed ""amiss"". That changed today. A hospice worker came into the place and discovered the homeowner's husband in the shower with my grandmother, and he was forcing her to do certain sexual acts on him that I don't care to elaborate on.

Authorities have been notified and there is currently an investigation underway. It goes without saying, but my father plans on suing the company. We currently don't know how long this has been transpiring, as the homeowner's husband (who owns the facility and is also certified to watch over the residents), takes over when the caretaker has a day off or goes to shop for the residents. I am sick to my stomach right now, and am having a hard time processing this sick, sick, act. My grandmother didn't deserve this, (no one does). She has been through so much during her life, and this time in her life was supposed to be safe and comfortable while we waited for the inevitable to happen with her Alzheimers.  Her mental condition has noticeably gotten worse than before within the last few months, and I suspect that this monster had something to do with it. My heart is breaking for her and my family, and I'm at a loss.  


Edit: Updated some information I had wrong. I had said it was the caretaker's husband, but it was the homeowner's husband. I also just found out my grandmother has been there for 8 years, not 5. I also wanted to thank everyone who's reached out.

Original Post Below:

Finding a therapist was super intimidating for me at first and when I was extremely depressed, figuring out how to find a therapist was next to impossible.

Now that I'm in a better place, I really enjoy helping people find the help they need by clearing away the confusing parts about therapy specialties, insurance, etc, etc. I'm a 26-year-old man who has gone through the therapist search process a handful of times personally and for several friends. It's a rewarding way to give back and I'd like to think I'm good at it by now. To be clear, I don't have any kind of medical degree/license-- I actually work in IT. You can stay anonymous during our conversations, but as a rule, I will keep anything you tell me confidential.

Our process will look something like this:

1. Search for therapists with your criteria (insurance/no insurance, male/female therapists, geographic distance, etc)
2. Put a list of potential therapists together
3. Leave a bunch of voicemails (don't worry, we'll do a bunch together or I can tell you what you need to say)
4. Wait for callbacks and schedule first appointments

DM me two or three sentences about you and if I have the time, I'll reach back out.

numfg5,therapy,1623097066.0,"I'm just discovering HOW MUCH I'm used to ignore my body on a daily basis. Even in the dumbest things like delaying the urge to pee. I have been doing it for so many years that I didn't realise it. I just didn't get how everybody else needed to use the toilet between 2 hour long lessons while I could just go without peeing for half a day and be fine (it partly had to do with me being dehydrated cause I also postponed drinking water) And the same with going to sleep, like what if we ACTUALLY went to bed the first moment we felt sleepy? Why put it off just for the sake of productivity or whatever it is that we are doing?

Also I'm starting to adress and release my emotions by recognising where do I feel them in my body. If I want to keep that emotion I try to do something that will intensify/prolongue that feeling and if I want to be able to move on from it I think of something that will relax that part for my body.

Like for example, an hour ago I was angry and felt it right behind my mouth and I felt like laughing would be nice, so I did with some YouTube videos and now I'm more calm and can concentrate on studying. But 3 days ago I was angry as well and I felt it at the crown of my head and in a more agressive way so I went for a run and shouted a bit into the emptyness and that worked too

(Obviously this doesn't mean I'm ignoring what made me angry, if I could fix it I would go right away and confront that person/change the situation, but I'm finding myself in situations I can't control and forced to interact with people who don't understand me so this my only way to manage it by the moment)

Does anybody else feel this way or do this as well? This is being such an exciting part of reparenting myself and I want everybody to experience the same.

mumsc7,therapy,1618911893.0,"I had a psychotic breakdown in 2018, and after mental hospital and some antpsychotics I resumed my hectic life scedule. 

About a year ago I started hearing a voice that would repeat things like, ""Please... please... please"" or ""Help me"" or ""I love you"" over and over. About two weeks ago it started speaking full sentences, where previously I tried to hear what it was saying but only heard mumbling without clear words.

So I went to my psychiatrist to update my meds. I told her about the voice and she prescribed 4x the initial dose of antipsychotics. She also changed out my antidepressants to a more OCD focussed one.

Since I started on the meds the voice has gone quiet. Before the change it was like I was still living in a kind of fog, not completely in reality. I mean now that I'm fully in reality I cant believe I've been living on the edge of it ever since my breakdown. I also had this epic feeling of anxiety and dread 24/7 up until they changed my meds.

If I was better able to relay what I was feeling at the time of the breakdown they could probably have fixed my problem much sooner.

Also reality isn't as scary as I thought. When I slip into non-reality, that is essentially a defence mechanism where I dissociate from reality since I cannot mentally survive the cold truth of it, or that is basically what I was programmed into doing after suffering trauma in my childhood developmental years. I dissociated from my surroundings into a much better world, and in this way I could survive.

This defence mechanism still kicks in when I get triggered. I got badly triggered and fell into a psychotic state, i. e. mental breakdown. I just remember being terrified beyond anything I could imagine, and not being able to come back into reality. I couldn't understand what was wrong with me and how something simple could send me into such a complete state of panic.

Long story short. Meds and therapy fixed me, and I'm now really balanced. Take yer meds. :p",https://www.reddit.com/r/therapy/comments/mumsc7/meds_killed_the_voice_in_my_head/,Meds killed the voice in my head.,,212,14,0.98

Since my therapist is no longer seeing patients in office and I don‚Äôt own a car, my room is the only place I can have my sessions.

mhfs0i,therapy,1617224841.0,"I'm an MSW and LCSW living in Oregon and in October of 2020 I was hired by Better Help to provide on line therapy (right in the middle of the pandemic). I mostly REALLY loved it. It was like doing house calls. I require my patients to have video sessions so I can really assess them and know who I'm talking to. I got to see their pets, their kids and their kitchens and bedrooms. They felt much more comfortable and it gave me a whole new perspective than the one I'd experienced when they came to my office in the past. Most of them were really cool people who worked hard at getting well and I was making a difference.

There were a couple of weird things: patients could be anonymous (NOT the community standard of care) and without any contact information.

Some patients wanted therapy via chat only. NO

But the weirdest thing of all happened about two weeks ago. Here's the language taken from the counselor's handbook.

  

""For messaging, any communication that is imbalanced will not be compensated:

\* Generally, any words that you write over 2x what the client writes, or any words that that client writes over 2x what you write, are considered imbalanced.""

Okay. This includes assessments, post session summary notes, termination notes, psychoeducation notes and notes from a patient that may say ""I feel like giving up"" I have 10 words with which to respond to that or I will be out of compliance and I will not be paid for my work. 

It's important to know that these messages are the most utilized method of communicating anything the patient needs you to know between sessions. They are the only way to get important written information to your patient. Now that communication is capped. Phone calls have to be scheduled in advance like appointments. Your patient can't just call you  unless you give them your personal cell. Frowned upon and usually not that great of an idea. 

You should also know that there was a not so veiled threat included in prior info from the site that threatened consequences against counselors who did not comply. There was no explanation and no justification for the decision.

mx7dbp,therapy,1619218945.0,"The title sounds really really bad, I know, but there's more to it. It's not because I have some weird superiority complex that I need to feed, I swear. It's that I have severe social anxiety, and it would seem that people who I subconsciously perceive to be worse than me (in some significant way, or in general) make me subconsciously feel like I don't need to concern myself with whether or not I'm a utility to them somehow.

For example, I play a lot of shooter games, and I had a friend named dizzy who I've been playing with for a good couple of months. He's nice, and alright at the game, but I never got over my social anxiety with him. Every time he talks my brain freezes, and everytime I say something, I 2nd guess it and think I sound like an idiot even tho weve interacted almost every day for months. Later on tho, he introduces me to a friend of his named Max. Max is also a super great person, but he's kind of butt at the game, which is really putting it mildly. For some reason, even tho I've known him way shorter, I don't feel anxious around him at all. It's like my brain knows that if I say something stupid, he won't care, or im not at risk of being evaluated over it, and because of that, I end up not saying stupid stuff, which makes it even better. I don't understand at all.

Before I posted this, I did a lot of introspection trying to figure out why my brain sometimes makes me immune to anxiety with only a very few certain people, and the first paragraph is what I came up with. I want to know if therapy can possibly make me feel this way with everyone, because right now, there's only 3 people (well call them Max, Marvin, and Dan) in the entire world that I feel this way with, and I literally (yes, literally) need to stop, close my eyes, and desperately try to tell my brain that ""I'm talking to Marvin"" to try to feel comfortable around people who aren't them.

Also, for a bit more context, the anxiety I have around other people really is bad. it's just not a slight, but appreciated comfort gain when I talk to these people. It's like I can only talk like myself around them, and otherwise struggle to even produce a simple sentence. It's so significant that around them, I don't even recognize myself because of how different I sound, and how different it feels in my head to suddenly not be anxious. I didn't know any of them before 2017, and before that, I hadn't had a single non-anxiety ridden conversation for over a decade.

I see a few posts like these so I thought I‚Äôd make one and try and clarify things.  Probably different in other countries though.

Everything you say to a therapist is confidential unless there is a risk of seriously hurting yourself, someone else or suspected/proof of child abuse.

When people talk about hurting themselves, that doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean they break confidentiality and zip you of to hospital.

They want to assess your safety.  Hospitals should always be an absolute last resort.  This means asking you questions like - how common are your thoughts of suicide? Do you have a plan of hurting yourself - when/where/how?  What‚Äôs stopped you so far? What other support or coping skills do you have?

It is really common to have suicidal thoughts but not have any active thoughts or plans.  Therapists just want to help the best way that they can.

It‚Äôs ok to talk to your therapist. It can be really scary but you‚Äôre not alone.

shexwk,therapy,1643669831.0,"Hi! 

I went to a new therapist for the first (and last) time today. As I have done in the past with therapist switches, I gave her my last psychiatrists evaluation - containing bipolar disorder diagnosis, anxiety diagnosis and ED diagnosis. I also had ptsd from being assaulted by a teacher at 10 years old, but as that was a ‚Äúhad‚Äù, I didn‚Äôt feel the need to bring that up in the initial session. 

This resulted in her yelling at me for 75 minutes, telling me I do not have any of those diagnoses - I am just lazy, unstructured and ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt know how to fill my fridge with normal food‚Äù. She did not ask me any of my history, all she knew about me is that I have a job and education - which apparently voids any mental disorders. 

I don‚Äôt have anyone to talk to about this, but I do need to get it out of my head somehow, so I‚Äôm just gonna leave some quotes from our session here. 

‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt have an eating disorder and gain weight. For you to have an eating disorder you have to be underweight and have deficiencies. You are just lazy and don‚Äôt know how to fill up your fridge with food that is good for you‚Äù 

‚ÄúYou just want someone to constantly hold your hand and make your decisions for you, I can‚Äôt do that for you, but maybe your doctor knows someone‚Äù

‚ÄúYou can not have this disorder and have a bachelors degree in engineering‚Äù 

‚ÄúYour problem is doing too much, you don‚Äôt have time to eat properly, that‚Äôs your problem, you should take out several weeks of sick leave to learn how to cook and get some structure in your life‚Äù 

‚ÄúYou are 28 years old, it‚Äôs time to grow up and take care of yourself, by yourself‚Äù 

‚ÄúYou have probably never been mentally ill, who diagnosed you?‚Äù 

I did not do a lot of talking during the session, as I was really taken aback by her assumptions and rude tone of voice, so this is all her making assumptions about how I live my life, and that I am making up everything I struggle with.

She also blamed a lot of my feelings on alcohol, which is funny because I drink alcohol max 3-4 a year. (She didn‚Äôt ask me how often/much I drink)

Want to have friends? Keep your people pleasing on a leash so they don't use you but also try to be vulnerable and work your emotions, remember everything you've been working on. Want a relationship? Even worse. All that but also try to remember all red flags to not let your trauma choose a shitty partner because you want to relieve it to try to fix what happened when you were a child.

I didn't live with her so the last time I got to visit was mid October, I made plans to visit again for my 19th birthday on Nov 4. She had been really sick for a few months so I tried to visit as often but didn't want to risk getting her sick with covid going on and such. My fiance and I left around 4am nov 2 and drove the couple hours after getting a call she was moved to ICU. Her liver was failing and one of her lungs failed. She could see me there with her and, I could see in her eyes how excited she was to see me but when she tried to talk she realized she couldn't and just gave up and stared off, her eyes glazed over, skin so dry and yellow.. all I could do was hold her hand and cry into the mask I was wearing. They would only let me go in alone. I sat with her, I even waxed her eyebrows for her like she had begged me to on our last phonecall a few nights before. Later the doctor  had explained that her liver couldn't process the pain meds, her heart was failing, the respirator could only be induced for so long due to humidity buildup, but she couldn't breathe on her own either. So, no matter what she was pretty much doomed. By that time they allowed my nana in with me (my mom's mom) and gave us the decision. After calling my 16 yo brother we finalized the decision, and she passed only a few minutes later, we sat with her for a while, I lied on her chest for the last time which I I found comforting as morbid as that might sound. A week later a funeral was held. Seeking support from my father was a mistake, as he's upset because by law he'll have to pay child support to me, since my brother lives with me and we're taking care of him. I'm not sure what to do, I try to keep myself busy with work, I still feel like there's something missing. We talked about trying for a baby but financially we aren't ready.

- client ‚ÄúI feel like everyone in my life will leave me because I‚Äôm not good enough‚Äù

I've been on so many different medications. Seen different therapists and psychiatrists. I used to stay up all night almost every single night researching. I tried so many different coping mechanisms.

Some of it did help me. I'm much better at managing my emotions, being mindful, and understanding situations. To be honest, though, I still feel like shit. CBT just didn't do much for my past trauma and PTSD or ADHD.

I'm 22 and can't keep a job. I can barely go through with job interviews due to the anxiety. Even when I have a job, I eventually freak out. I keep having to take breaks from college. I don't drive often because it stresses me out so much. If I push myself too hard, I will still freak out. I don't really have close friends anymore. All of my relationships have been unhealthy. All of this is after around 4 years straight of very consistent CBT therapy.

I felt like a failure for so long. I'm not. White knuckling life just does not work for me. CBT just is not right for me. I'm going to try EMDR as soon as I can for my trauma. If you have trauma, I'd suggest looking into EMDR and SCHEMA therapy specifically. If you feel similar at all and you're losing hope, don't. It's not your fault. It's not because you aren't trying hard enough. You need what will work for you.

It‚Äôs very rare for him to cancel on me so it‚Äôs been concerning that he‚Äôs rescheduled our last couple of sessions.
During our session today, he revealed to me that his wife was diagnosed with cancer two months ago and there‚Äôs no chance of recovery. Her doctors are doing what they can to prolong her life but they don‚Äôt know how much time she has left.

I was so shocked and saddened to hear this. I would never have guessed what he‚Äôs going through because his demeanor has seemed the same as usual, which is a sign to me that he‚Äôs professional and doesn‚Äôt let his personal life get in the way of his work.

He was so beautiful, long blonde hair and he loved the blues and blind melon. He was a chef and a skateboarder (hardcore skater) he was fearless in almost every sense of the word and he stood up for people he cared about. He was a ‚Äúbooster‚Äù always wanted everyone to shine around him. He was kind and compassionate and pure. I woke up lastnight and couldn‚Äôt go back to sleep I don‚Äôt normally think about his body afterwards.. But lastnight I remembered how beautiful he was even in death. He was familiar even then I kissed him one more time and it was so wrong it broke me. It sent me on a spiral lastnight.. He hung himself with a scarf my best friend gave him and there was a purple ring around his neck that they tried to hide with a scarf they bought that wasn‚Äôt his style he has fingernail scratches on his arms from struggling.. these images haunt me... I had him for awhile In this cold room saying goodbye to someone who was already gone. I don‚Äôt normally remember him that way. Not ever. I dont want to. I was so broken that the trauma has made me forget details like how I got there.. I don‚Äôt remember how I got home.. I don‚Äôt know. Regardless, I thought of those final moments with his body in an insomnia spell.. I fell asleep eventually and I dreamt about him.. We were huddled up by this old fireplace and just laughing and joking around.. Im a comedian and he was really funny too we cracked jokes all the time and we both just thought we were hilarious. So thats where we were.. Just giggling and holding onto one another by the fire. I woke up with that familiar tearing feeling it feels like someones tearing my heart in half I normally hold onto a pillow for dear life and cry it out. Its hard to face reality when hes not here it used to be confusing now its just reality.. I want to also note that his suicide was labeled ‚Äúaccidental suicide‚Äù he suffered from manic depression bipolar disorder and when he drank alcohol it exasperated symptoms and made him.. Different.. He was different that night slamming things playing loud music and I left him to go stay at my grandmothers house up the street because I needed to get sleep I managed a store and was opening the next day.. He begged me to stay with him and I left he said if I leave hes going to kill himself it seemed so ridiculous that I kinda rolled my eyes I told him ‚ÄúI love you..  just go to bed Walter‚Äù shortly after he did it.

m17lht,therapy,1615300373.0,"You are not your feelings.

People wrongly identify with their feelings. They feel anxious, so they tell themselves a story, ‚ÄòI‚Äôm anxious, I have anxiety.‚Äô This leads to living a life in which we‚Äôre trying to avoid certain feelings or chasing others.

We reach a state of calm. Then we start to think about how to hold on to it. How to stay in this state forever. Then the calm is gone and we‚Äôre anxious again.¬†

Understand: Your feelings are impermanent. You are meant to feel. Emotions exist so that we can feel them, the full range. Happy, sad, bored, discontent.

Stop thinking about your feelings as a permanent state and realize you have the power to change it.

When you think of Mike Tyson, ‚ÄòIron Mike,‚Äô ‚ÄòThe Baddest Man on the Planet.‚Äô A career record of 50-6, 44 knockouts, arrested more than 30 times before he was 13. You don‚Äôt think of someone who felt a lot of fear.¬†

It‚Äôs hard to imagine him¬†in tears¬†before a fight. Pacing around outside crying and overcome by anxiety and fear. Tyson‚Äôs trainer and adopted father, Cus D‚ÄôAmato would say, ‚ÄúThe hero and the coward both feel the same thing, but the hero uses his fear.‚Äù¬†

Tyson felt fear, it was a feeling he had. But then he moved forward. After those tears is a fight that was stopped in his favor after about 35 seconds. Thoughts, emotions, feelings. They‚Äôre like clouds, they come and go. Not here forever. Not gone forever.¬†

In¬†***The Wisdom of Insecurity***, Alan Watts explains that if, ‚Äúwe are to be fully human and fully alive and aware, it seems that we must be willing to suffer for our pleasures.‚Äù

If you never want to feel sad. You‚Äôll never feel happy. If you never want to feel anxious, you won‚Äôt know contentment. If you‚Äôve never had a bad day, you won‚Äôt recognize a great one. The alternative to feeling is numbness. It‚Äôs bland, mediocre and average. It‚Äôs half alive.¬†¬†

You can‚Äôt control your feelings, but you can control how you react to them. Accept that your feelings are impermanent. They come and go.

gwxhai,therapy,1591330245.0,"So 2 weeks ago I started doing some inner child work with my therapist which meant sharing a traumatic experience from childhood and the story I shared as just a backstory to the story that I intend to share, made my therapist's jaw drop and go speechless. I never got to the intended story because the back story for context was traumatic enough to need some hashing out, apparently. I guess it just made it more clear how compounded some of the emotional trauma was that my father inflicted on us. I generally find it amusing to see people's reactions when they find out some of the ""mundane"" things my siblings and I went through, not for perverse reasons, just feels kind of validating that it was indeed as crazy as it sounds. Kind of a dark humor or something. 

Well today I had another session where I shared another complex/compounded trauma story and my therapist actually teared up and cried a bit for what I went through.  I wasn't exactly expecting that and it honestly made me sad about something I've tried to get over and stop reacting to in any way other than with a dull removed anger. I'm not very good at the inner child visualizations/imagery stuff and feel resistant or something to it, but I definitely felt that little kid pain come on full force after seeing my therapist, who likely deals with tons of other people's traumas, react in such a truly horrified and sad way. 

I don't know how to feel about it I guess.  I'm used to sharing snippets of my past to explain my no contact choices in very matter of fact ways and getting the typical, ""I'm sorry that happened,  that makes sense"" type reactions or even sharing in an understanding bond with someone with similar types of trauma about how crazy people can be, but I guess I'm no longer used to sharing old pain from the raw, still open wound perspective. I imagine I'll be reliving a lot of these moments without the comfort of solitude and having to face the reaction of someone else who will confirm how painful it all was and still is. In some ways I'd like to record these reactions and make my father sit through them for each and every one as a way to make him accountable, though I have actually no expectation of him being capable of such a thing.",https://www.reddit.com/r/therapy/comments/gwxhai/made_therapist_cry/,Made therapist cry,,177,32,0.98

po9kr3,therapy,1631647217.0,"I've never really had any sort of passion or specific starry-eyed goal, even as a child. When I was in pre-school, it was my turn to be the ""star of the week"" and get a poster made of all my favorite things. My teacher asked me what I wanted to be when I grew up. I honestly didn't understand the question. I asked her what she meant and she clarified-""who do you want to become? what do you want to do?"" So I told her ""a lady!"" and she taped a generic photo of a businesswoman to my poster.

As I got to elementary school, I finally understood what she meant, but I had a problem. I wanted to do everything! I would tell people that I wanted to be a ""princess-singer-dancer-artist-dolphin trainer-marine biologist-author-scientist-butterfly lady-figure skater-pianist-actress-librarian in space!!"". To which the average adult would tell me that it was too much and I'd eventually have to pick one. I started to try all kinds of things and took all sorts of lessons, but eventually quit them all. I'm not quite sure why I ended up quitting everything. Maybe I just didn't like being told what to do, or working hard, or I got bored. It could have just been the looming cloud of puberty. I was actually quite good at everything I tried, hardly practicing, even getting recognition from my teachers until I'd inevitably hit a wall that I couldn't get over. Perhaps it was that ""gifted"" kid thing where I was talented but didn't know how to work hard and got frustrated when I wasn't good at something. Whatever it was, by the time I was 15, I quit all of my activities. Piano, flute, ballet, chemistry club, school newspaper, horseback riding, dance club, and figure skating (which I did for over a decade).

In high school, after years of being incredibly unhappy, I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder, depressive disorder, and adhd. I was still doing fine in school, but I was definitely overcompensating and yet, at the same time, hardly trying. I didn't feel like doing anything anymore, nothing was fun and I had no goals. But it was time to apply for colleges. I applied because of the societal expectations, got into the one my brother went to, and picked some bullshit major my brother told me would be versatile. Everyone thought I'd end up doing either an art or science degree, both of which I love if you look at that list of things I wanted to be when I was a kid, but theyre on complete opposite sides of the education spectrum. It's hard to find any overlap there. Science I love but didn't think I could do with my work ethic and scattered brain, and art required a portfolio, which I didn't have because I never took proper classes or felt I wasn't good enough. I was a jack of all trades, but master of none, if you will. So I got my degree in Media and Communication ***Studies***. Not a communication degree, or marketing-its just the study of how media works and how it affects people. My mom hates my degree and so do I.

Post-grad, I interned at a tech company on their internal marketing team, which I absolutely hated. I was fine at doing the work they told me to do, but I found no joy in it. I can't be ""on"" all the time like most marketing people are. I'm not good at appealing to people. I guess I could learn, but I really felt empty. Then, I moved to South Korea for a year and a half to teach English. I had a good time and the kids liked me, but it exhausted me. It required social energy that I just don't have. I do still have teaching in the back burner of my mind just in case, though. And now, I freelance proofread and edit documents. I have a decent-looking resume, but haven't been able to get hired full-time anywhere yet. I've lost steam looking for some bullshit editing job, or digital marketing job, anything along those lines. Somehow my whole family started knowing me as the ""marketing one"" even though I've never done proper external marketing.

So now here I am, mid-late twenties, living back at home again, and no idea where to take my life. I want to do everything, just like I did when I was a kid, but I don't have the education or experience. I want to do science, I want to do art, but I want to make my parents proud, I want to make money, I want to enjoy myself even though I know there is no job that you'll love every day. I feel left behind, too old, too dumb, too inexperienced, too broke to go back to school or to take lessons. I'm scared that if I pick a direction, I'll leave it behind like I did before, get bored, hate it, and be back to square one. On top of that, I'm stupidly self-conscious. I know you'll always miss if you never aim at something, but I don't know what to aim for. Everything seems ""meh"" and I hate how stupid of a problem this is. All I've ever wanted was to experience everything, but that's not how the world works now.",https://www.reddit.com/r/therapy/comments/po9kr3/ive_26f_dont_have_a_single_passion_or_dream_and/,I've (26F) don't have a single passion or dream and don't know where to take my life.

1) 99% of Therapists are full to capacity and are not seeking new patients. If you have a question that‚Äôs one thing and if it‚Äôs serious dial 911. That‚Äôs what you are told.

2) When any member of my family did reach a contact the questions asked back is ‚Äúummm have you ever been in therapy before? Are you even in the system? 

3) The recommendation from therapists was to talk to family and friends and one referral was to a very person who was part of the trauma leading to a need for therapy 

4) Very expensive out of pocket costs

And we found it, the root of the problem. We spent months working on the why and i feel about a month ago, that i had a ""break through"" because we truly discovered *why* i cannot let go and why i havent met my goal and why i cant get over this thing... and now its like i still cannot reach my therapeutic goal and im starting to think, that maybe there are just somethings that the human brain is not meant to let go of, that that feeling, memory, imprint is there and youll never escape it bc it was that important....

Which worries me because i dont want to feel this way forever which is why i started therapy in the first place.

Is it possible that there are just some things in life that the mind will not transform into something positive, or let go, or change a belief? I feel like i just want to be free from this , but theres the other part of me that doesnt want to be free bc letting go hurts just as much. Why wont my unconscious mind comply with my logic ? Why am not able to just ... get there in therapy?? I do believe i really know the answer why it just goes back to my childhood and my inner child for sure...

Everyone talks about how the mental health care system is broken and that it's notoriously expensive.

TW: Sexual abuse, harassment and suicide 

&#x200B;

As the title suggests, it's basically the story of my childhood. For reference, I am guy.

&#x200B;

I am not sure where to start. I have been carrying around a lot of baggage with me for many many years now and I am not sure how to deal with it. Growing up, I was molested and harassed as a young child. After that, I went through some pretty gnarly bullying in school.

&#x200B;

Without going into many details, I will say that I was molested at multiple occasions by multiple people in my life (nobody was a close family member though, I feel it's important to mention that). I was too young to recognize what was happening at the time (first it happened would have to be when I was like 5 maybe, too young to even remember the age). It was one of the neighbors kids who we would hangout with. That happened a few times. Then some other guys did the same at different times after that. All obviously older than me. I'd say it all happened before I was like 12-13.

&#x200B;

Then as puberty hit, I was getting these new urges just like any other teenager would. I was excited and nervous about talking to girls but never really had the balls to do it. That's around the time when I started to get bullied a lot in school. Especially in my school bus, where the bullying and harassment culture is very very prevalent. There was a guy who'd just make me feel like shit everyday when I was in about 6th grade. I would be made fun of every single thing I did. If I ever dared to try something new (just exploring innocent childhood curiosities), I'd be made fun of. Eventually I started breaking down and losing confidence in myself. I was starting to change from a carefree, fun loving child into a depressed and scared teenager.

&#x200B;

As years went along the bullying got worse. There was a period of time when I was getting constantly made fun of and physically harassed by both guys and girls. There was this tough acting girl. Bunch of guys would tell her I talked shit about her and she would come and try to fight me. She never got to beat me up properly but the fights got very physical and equally matched. I was a tall lanky kid so I didn't have a lot going for me. It was the most humiliating thing for me at the time. This was accompanied by the guys constantly laughing at me and making fun of me over and over.

&#x200B;

The bullying eventually stopped and was replaced with verbal bullying for about a year or so. After that I had pretty much lost it. I was having suicidal thoughts and I somehow kept going through it. I am afraid I also took part in bullying other younger kids as I got older. I am not gonna justify it with anything. I never did anything insane but I made fun of a lot of kids when I had the chance. I feel horrible about it and there's no excuse for it.

&#x200B;

Needless to say, by the time I was in the last 2 years of high school, I had no confidence left in me and I was absolutely horrified of talking to people. To this day, I get ptsd from some of those days and it's been a lot of years since then. Naturally, I always had trouble with even making friends let alone have any romantic prospects with anyone.

&#x200B;

There are a few other important things here that I am choosing to skip because they'd give away a little too much probably.

&#x200B;

What I didn't realize was that all of this would lead to some fucked up problems that'd ruin my life. Because of so many sexual encounters as a kid, I have so much intense hypersexuality issues that I cannot deal with. I am addicted to masturbation now and I cannot seem to control it. I have tried giving it up and the most I was able to achieve was like a week. Not only that, I grew up believing I was straight but I still keep having thoughts about men sometimes. I have explored with men and I think I might be bisexual. It would be fine but I can't help but think that it directly stems from me being molested as a kid. I also have horrible power fantasies where essentially I have to feel horrible and humiliated in order to feel anything. What makes it worse is that I pretty much feel nothing with men romantically, it is all sexual. It isn't always the case and I have had some pretty good and healthy sex in my later years. I am atleast happy about that.

&#x200B;

My torment, so to speak, pretty ended in school but the impact still stays strong into my 20s. I can't understand social queues, I either can't trust people easily or I end up trusting them too much. I say horrible things to people that are intended as jokes but end up hurting people. I have a hard time maintaining friendships. I breakdown pretty easily. I have anger issues. I can't seem to focus on thing for more than 5 minutes. It has taken a lot of hard work to start to feel comfortable in my own skin.

&#x200B;

I constantly feel like a failure. It isn't even a lie tbh. I like to be creative and I keep failing at every little endeavor I try to pursue. Right now I have been jobless since graduation and struggling to find a career. It's eating me up from the inside. I have so many things to deal with and at any given moment I am ready pull my hair out. These are struggles that normally every person goes through but I can't help but feel like life has something against me.

&#x200B;

Nobody really knows about all this stuff. I have only talked to one person about it and that relationship didn't really last. I am always afraid that I will push my friends away if I say anything so I keep it to myself. I like to be funny but my humor doesn't always land or ends up being too dark and depressing. I am scared and lonely most of the time deep down. It's a warzone in my head at all times.

&#x200B;

I have tried free therapy in school and that went about as well as you'd expect. On my own, I tried some free online cbt but cbt tends to focus more on present while I need to process my childhood first. I can't afford actual therapy right now so this post is all I have.

&#x200B;

Please understand that I am not doing this for sympathy. It took a lot for me to write this and I don't think I can take this anywhere else.

jowq64,therapy,1604630242.0,"Just broke up with my therapist of two years after they crossed a very serious boundary. I think I handled it very well and am pleased with myself and my ability to maintain assertiveness, but it's time to put it in writing and get some outside perspectives. 

This person was my first therapist, so I never really had any other experiences to which to compare our sessions. Insurance paid for them 100%, so I don't feel that I've been cheated out of anything, but I do think I placed a lot of faith and vulnerable trust into this professional, simply based on the fact that they're being paid, so they are obligated to have my best interest in mind. A simple exchange of money for services. This person definitely helped me process a number of things throughout the years, and it felt good to have an unbiased source to go to, to sort things out in a rational way, or reframe situations that I may have distorted personally. Essentially placed all my faith into what this person was telling me, and trusted their judgment due to their credentials and the positive outcomes I experienced after our sessions. 

I personally also work in the mental health field, though not at the level where I can practice psychotherapy myself, but the foundations of a therapeutic relationship are very obvious to me due to my work and education. I do think I noticed a number of red flags during my sessions, but I chalked up most of them to this person's airheaded personality - coding sessions wrong, continuing sessions for longer than an hour, or even leaving paperwork laying around from previous clients (I once recognized paperwork for someone I know personally). Either way, they didn't necessarily harm me, and regarding billing, I actually feared I was benefitting from it - like that Monopoly card about a ""Bank error in your favor, collect $50."" So I let it go. Hey, I'm still getting effective treatment right? 

This person ended up writing a letter of recommendation to my PCP for a specific prescription medication that would benefit me, and I ended up receiving it, and am still reaping the positive results over a year later. However, this person also told me that they're taking the same script personally. Now I know that I would *never* speak to my clients about my personal prescriptions, even in the context of discussing medications. I've received loads of training through school and on-site trainings specifically explaining why this is unethical. But on the receiving end, my relationship with my therapist had become so blurred, that I couldn't notice this error in time. We would regularly discuss the positive effects of the meds, or they'd highlight how the meds are helping in situations that weren't necessarily clear beforehand. 
This was a person I could go to regularly, to process specific events, and I felt safe and secure that I'd be taken care of, without bias. Again, I had no other standard of comparison besides my own relationships with my clients, due to this being my first receiving therapeutic alliance. 

One evening, my therapist sent me a text message asking me if I could let them have a few of my pills until their script could be refilled. I'd been asleep when it came through, but woke up in the middle of the night and read it. I'd gotten another unrelated, but concerning message from a friend around the same time, so I wasn't really in the proper head space to process either message. But even in my dazed state, I knew that boundary had been crossed. Mind racing...I say yes, then I'm out of meds for a few days. No? That hurts the relationship. I don't owe this person anything. That's not what this relationship is about. Will I get proper treatment after giving a no? That's when it became clear that this is the reason those boundaries get emphasized for us caregivers. That responsibility is on the giver to maintain that consistency. I struggled all day, ruminating. If they are crossing this ethical boundary, what else is being affected in my treatment? How can I know that my HIPAA rights are being respected, for example? I knew I had to end this relationship and replied, saying it made me highly uncomfortable, but that I'd like to speak about it in person. 


We met that evening for our regular scheduled session, and I came right out, explaining how inappropriate and unethical I found this message to be. The fact that they shouldn't be relying on me for ANYTHING. I did get an apology, but it was quickly followed by a ""...however..."" The person ended up talking about offering other maintenance meds to long-term clients when they couldn't get their scripts in time. I get it, I said, it's still a serious violation, and totally illegal, but it's still forgivable since this person is *caring* for their clients' physical well-being. Egregious, but forgivable. The difference between that and my situation was the fact that *I* was being expected to assist someone who's being paid to work with *me.* This person went on to say sorry again, but they were under the impression this was a ""cool, give and take sorta deal."" Definitely didn't hear what I was saying. Another big red flag that is consistently emphasized in my work. Can't be doing good processing sessions if you're not hearing out your clients...

This person went on to say they understand if I'd like to leave, but ""it's not necessarily a deal breaker,"" because we've come so far and we work so well together, and I should look at the big picture. I started discussing power dynamics, got a bunch of nonsense about how it's not quite that because they weren't *exerting* power over me. Again, unheard. The final straw however, was the textbook manipulation that I've come to recognize almost immediately and has become my pet peeve when it comes to other folks interacting with my child clients. This person began listing all the ""favors"" they've done for me...keeping me around for longer sessions that weren't billed accordingly, extra phone calls during minor crises, and the fact that they weren't being paid due to the coding issues. Do. Not. Hold. Shit. Over. Me. That. I. Didn't ask you for. At this point, my feelings of betrayal switched to confidence.

Watching this person squirm and manipulate to get me to stay, and knowing the power is mine, and I'm not being affected by it at all. I offered to reach out to the insurance company one more time to make sure they get paid for sessions that we've already completed, but I wouldn't be coming back. Once again, I got the ""this shouldn't be a deal breaker, but you do what you need to do"" bit. 

The entire conversation was extremely calm, and not heated in any way, but as we walked out to our respective cars, they ran back to my window one last time, and said, ""I know this goes without saying, but I'm asking you to not share this with anyone please."" 

""Sure, doctor, I wouldn't want to hurt you, but I don't want to be hurt anymore either.""

After processing with a friend, another perspective was brought up that I should look into where I could turn to ensure that this experience doesn't happen to their other clients. I'm a bit anxious that after opening up with 2 years' worth of baggage, that it can be used against me, and there's a precedent that this person's ethical standards are subpar for the job. 

I need to start shopping around for a new one, in order to process this relationship as well, but I do think it will be a struggle to place this much blind trust in another professional in the future. I'm grateful for this person for helping me grow and develop this ability to stick up for myself, but also very defeated that my ignorant bliss has been torn away. I have not met anyone in my personal life who had manipulated me this successfully, and it will most likely leave a mark on my ability to trust a professional other than myself. To be gaslit by the very person who was entrusted to make me a healthier human seems like one of the worst ways to experience this feeling, exception being an intimate partner. 

Like I said, I'm very confident that I handled this in the best possible way, and am proud of how I handled this experience, but am very curious about outside feedback, as I am not comfortable opening up to friends and family about it in my personal life yet. Would love to brag about my newfound assertiveness, but ashamed of my being duped for so long.

iyznsl,therapy,1600962327.0,"TL;DR: My first loves cousin raped me repeatedly and I‚Äôm finally going to tell. 

When I was 15(f) I had the most amazing boyfriend in the world. Man, I loved him and he loved me. I know it sounds silly and maybe I‚Äôve built it up to be something it wasn‚Äôt. But I always thought he was the one.  One night, my boyfriends 28 year old cousin was supposed to give me a ride home from church. My boyfriend wasn‚Äôt there. He kissed me, and I guess I kissed him back. but then sexually assaulted me. I never gave in and he finally said he shouldn‚Äôt be doing what he was, and stopped. He told me it was my fault, and I cheated on my boyfriend and id better not tell. I had trusted this guy because we had been talking on messenger for months. I didn‚Äôt realize he was grooming me. 

I clung to my boyfriend for dear life over that next school year, but when the summer came my boyfriend went away to work for a few months. His cousin had never left me alone; it got much, much worse. I was just a 16 year old kid and he was an adult man.  I didn‚Äôt know how to stop him. He gave me all the booze I could drink, since that‚Äôs the only way I could bear being with him. And I just let him do whatever he wanted to me. He said he wanted to get married. I told myself that if I went along with it for long enough, eventually it would be okay. It never was. 

The shame and guilt ran deep. I couldn‚Äôt handle it. I tried to tell my boyfriend when he came back in the fall but I only mustered out his cousin kissed me. I think I was having a mental breakdown. He asked me over and over if anything else happened. Too much shame, too much guilt. It was my fault. I never spoke to my boyfriend again. 

The abuse with his cousin went on for a while longer. Finally, some time near the end of grade 11 I decided I‚Äôd rather be dead than let it go on. I made sure lots of kids in my high school saw us together, and I finally escaped. It helped my friend started screaming PEDOPHILE!! the next time he cornered me. He left me alone after that. But I drank for 6 straight years to try to deal with it. 

16 years after it all ended, I finally thought it might not be my fault. I went to the sexual assault clinic and my amazing therapist said if it would give me closure, to reach out to my ex.  I got his number.  I just text him and said I wanted to apologize, but understood if he never wanted to speak to me again, and wished him well. I really hope he‚Äôs happy. I already feel like a huge weight is lifted off my shoulders by telling him I want to apologize. If I never hear back from him, I‚Äôll have to live with it. 

I‚Äôm sure he‚Äôs moved on. But I have been trapped in that day where I tried to tell him for 16 years. I never stopped loving him. I just couldn‚Äôt bear to continue what I thought was hurting him. I have had almost no emotion since this happened. But when I think about telling my ex, I either throw up or cry. I think this is what I need to do to finally get better.

jx2mla,therapy,1605792343.0,"So... I lived in a household of 4. It was my mom, my grandparents and myself. Now it's just the 3 of us.  


Here's some backstory:  


My grandfather raised me. I've never met my biological father, but it didn't matter because I had my grandfather. I've been by his side since I was born. I always followed him everywhere and I learned everything I know from him. He taught me to analyze and problem solve which is not a skill everyone possesses.  


Anyways...  


My mom has worked at a job for 21 years. During the pandemic, the company went under and was forced to sell, so she was left unemployed in September.

I came up with a plan that she get on unemployment for a little bit while the pandemic is happening so 1.) she could be safe, but 2.) so we could apply to a few different positions that would be upgrades from her previous job. Considering she had 21 years of experience, we could find her something that had better pay and benefits.   
I thought it was a solid plan...  


My grandmother got in her head and convinced her that she needed to apply for a job ASAP, even if it was low level and a step down from the job she had before. I talked to her again and tried to convince her that it was illogical and that my plan made more sense in the long run. Nope, she decided to follow what my grandmother said and applied with the company that bought the company she worked for before.  


Sure enough, there's a manager there and right away my mom disliked him because he was very condescending. He was much younger than everyone who worked there and he was also quite careless. He got sick and would show up to work without wearing a mask. In fact, he got tested for Covid and it came back positive but he showed up to work the next day as a ""surprise"" to the staff.  


So my mom ends up getting sick and decides she was going to quit because of the manager and the ""hostile"" environment. So she quits after being there for 3 weeks and brings it home and of course all 4 of us get Covid with pneumonia.  


Anyways, long story long, my grandpa didn't survive Covid and I feel lot's of regret because I couldn't be there to comfort him during his struggle. I couldn't be there as they removed the breathing tubes and he slowly suffocated for a day. I couldn't be there for any of it. And since I was sick, my last interaction with him was calling him on FaceTime and telling him that I loved him before the ambulance took him. It kills me because now that he's gone I'm hearing that he was scared and he didn't want to be intubated...  


I'm mad at my mom because I came up with a plan for her... It was a solid plan. And get this... after she quit her job, she came home and applied for unemployment and started applying for better jobs JUST LIKE I HAD ADVISED HER TO!!!

We're roughly similar in age and I've been seeing him for about a year and it was a normal therapist-patient relationship as far as I'm concerned, but something about his demeanor has changed recently. He started commenting on my outfits and glasses etc, which I initially took as him being friendly, he's just never done it before. But then he's also recently started saying things like he looks forward to our sessions because ""he likes me"". Which sure enough could also be friendly, but he's also more ""touchy"" than before. Not in an inappropriate way, just in a ""comforting, there there patting your shoulder"" way that he never really did before. Then he also gave me a way to contact him outside of work, stating he does that to his ""favorite"" patients if he feels it's safe, despite knowing he shouldn't be doing that. Even up until this I kept thinking he was being friendly and maybe he thinks we've gotten closer in our therapist-patient relationship now that it's been a year, and that's why he's acting a bit different. But then the last 2 sessions he spent the entire hour leaning closer towards me, leaning his head on his hand and elbow and staring deeply into my eyes. It looked so much like a classic romantic scene out of a movie it freaked me out a bit. I want to be wrong and I feel uncomfortable for even thinking it. I have not said anything to him and I don't even know how I would go about it tbh.

Edit: Thanks for all the answers. I wasn't sure if I was overreacting and being paranoid, it somehow didn't even occur to me that he could be predatory on purpose since he knows I'm in a vulnerable position. I guess either way bottom line is that he is making me uncomfortable and that's enough to end these therapy sessions and find someone else.",https://www.reddit.com/r/therapy/comments/qu3v2z/i_think_my_therapist_has_a_crush_on_me/,I think my therapist has a crush on me?,,164,68,0.98

I've struggled a lot with emotional dysregulation and getting frustrated easily (then being overwhelmed) and unfortunately my therapists until now were not able to give me practical strategies to help me with it.

A big part of therapy is having somebody to listen to and that is crucial and helpful, but another part of therapy is also learning the tools to get by on your own.

Workbooks are great for that.
You read about the issues and it's causes and can directly work and apply the strategies explained to your individual situation. 

If anyone struggles with similar issues of emotional dysregulation and poor coping strategies, I can recommend the DBT skills workbook by Matthew McKay and others (it has a green cover). You can also just google for other Workbooks by adding your relevant topic like ""trauma workbook"" etc.

iw24j3,therapy,1600554603.0,"
Most people I talk to who have serious struggles with mental health, abuse, trauma etc. say they try hard to hide their problems and appear to have the perfect life, that they actively dislike sympathy, pity, attention etc. Some people have even gone so far as to suggest that people with trauma and serious mental illness typically don‚Äôt want anyone to know about their issues or treat them differently so they hide it from everyone, while people who are just immature and attention-seeking ‚Äúget off‚Äù on receiving sympathy and pity and are more likely to open up about things, overshare, etc.

There is probably some truth to that and it makes me feel so bad about myself because I fall into the second camp. I can become addicted to pity and seeking out sympathy and feel a really strong desire to express my pain and be ‚Äúseen.‚Äù I am very aware and worried about how I come across to others, and very disgusted by this tendency, so I try very hard to avoid hide this from people but it‚Äôs still there and motivates some of my behavior. I fantasize about people being worried and concerned about me and even occasionally, subtly, try to elicit this response by oversharing. It‚Äôs so embarrassing to admit this. It seems very immature and self-absorbed and adolescent. 

To be clear, most of the time I want to hide my problems too. It‚Äôs only some people that trigger this perverse desire for sympathy and attention in me. Teachers and professors, and also potential romantic partners, tend to trigger some deep craving for sympathy and attention and caretaking. It‚Äôs really embarrassing but I definitely have a desire to be seen as a victim or somehow tragic. I fear most of all that people will see me as spoiled and entitled. I feel like I have no worth outside being a victim, and I fear that if I let go of it, I will be forced to face the truth of my own emptiness which is truly terrifying. Absolutely terrifying. 

This is really messed up, but it is painful for me to be reminded that ‚Äúeveryone has their own struggles.‚Äù I know that is true, I really do, and I remind myself of it all the time. But instead of feeling compassion and connection to humanity I just feel intense shame when I think about other people‚Äôs struggles. I try to feel grateful but I just feel like a horrible person for not feeling grateful if that makes sense. 

I feel like I‚Äôm supposed to be comforted by the fact that my struggles are not uniquely mine but instead I find it intensely painful because it implies (rightly) that I‚Äôm overly sensitive, selfish, entitled, and lacking in character and fortitude. 

If I acknowledge reality I also have to a knowledge some extremely unsettling things about myself. I guess it also forces me to accept that having intense feelings is just a part of life. And that I need to get over myself s this feels intolerable. This whole process feels intolerable. There is literally blackness at my core how am I expected to look at an accept the evil? And now I‚Äôm being dramatic again just to elicit sympathy, though I‚Äôm barely conscious of it. 

I don‚Äôt know if any of this is making sense. I‚Äôm crying a lot as I write this. It really bothers me and I feel so ashamed and disgusted with myself.

I honestly think I might have a personality disorder of some sort but then I wonder if that is just another way of getting off the hook, of trying to find a reason for my suffering so I don‚Äôt have to deal with it as directly, or acknowledge it‚Äôs mostly my own fault and/or simply something everyone has to deal with. 

It‚Äôs weird to realize about myself. Most people say I‚Äôm a really good person. My friend once told me I was the embodiment of egolessness. How ironic! My ego and ego defenses dominate my life and nearly everything I do. I don‚Äôt know how I can be so self-absorbed and yet still come across as good? I think people are confusing good with timid and fearful of making a mistake or seeming like a bad person (but it‚Äôs really all about me, not motivated by altruism).",https://www.reddit.com/r/therapy/comments/iw24j3/why_do_i_crave_sympathy_and_validation_so_much/,Why do I crave sympathy and validation so much?,,159,47,1.0

now, you may be wondering why you need this all the time and you cant erase it.

I'll tell you. What you are going to do is keep that thing that you write down with you at all times, then when something that makes you smile happens, immediately write it down (or if you are on your phone take a photo and save it to a folder for that specific purpose, but make sure you have permission first.). it doesn't matter how small it was, it could be a cloud that looked like a dog or a funny thing your friend showed you. write it down immediately. so then, you are in a bad mental space and struggling, you have a list of everything that gave you some amount of jo. and because you have written it down immediately, it'll have the memory to cheer you up and you can't brush it off because you wrote it down.

Hey everyone,

I recently started going to therapy because of a failed relationship which made me realize that I thrive off of toxicity and drama (my therapist doesn't believe my actions constitute emotional abuse but I am still not sure). It just feels like toxicity is so normal to me that even when a situation is completely positive I look for something to complain about or poke fun at or get angry over despite knowing it may hurt or upset those around me. I also can get very uncomfortable when someone expresses warmth towards me, especially when they say that they think I'm a good person. 

I'm working on getting progressively more aware and empathetic towards the people around me but I can't help but feel like I'm fighting a losing battle sometimes where I'm just getting better at hiding toxic traits rather than actually putting a stop to them. What I'm wondering is, is it really possible to ""unlearn"" traits that you've carried for as long as you can remember?",https://www.reddit.com/r/therapy/comments/k42n1c/has_anyone_ever_successfully_unlearned_toxic_and/,"Has Anyone Ever Successfully ""Unlearned"" Toxic and Bullying Mindsets?",,153,28,1.0

qfdz0d,therapy,1635158720.0," 

I am a 21-year-old American male living in Europe. In December of 2020, I had reached my lowest point and asked my parents if I could start seeing a therapist. My father found an American female therapist in my area who accepted our insurance plan. The first couple of months were great and I found myself making strides in the right direction. Occasionally she would say something that caught me off guard such as ‚Äúyou are very handsome‚Äù or ‚Äú you are the most attractive 21-year-old patient I‚Äôve had‚Äù. I just brushed it off thinking she was trying to help me with my confidence since I struggle with body image. A week ago she told me that she would like me to meet her new personal assistant who was my age because she thought we would get along well. I was hesitant and told her I would think about it. Then on Friday at 10:00 at night, I received an email from her with her personal assistant's phone number saying I should message her. Additionally, she said in the email that I was invited to her house anytime and I would fit in well in their ‚ÄúFamily‚Äù. 5 minutes later I received another email from my therapist, this time with her assistant's email attached. I waited until the next day to text her and we talked about our hobbies and interests. That night at 11:54 she told me that my therapist wanted to call me with a job offer. I felt uncomfortable but agreed and received a video call from my therapist saying that she was starting a new business and she wanted to hire me as a personal trainer. The next morning I received an email outlining what my job would be. The email stated that I would be moving into the apartment next to her and take her patients to the gym. A couple of things struck me as odd. She wanted to continue to bill my insurance to cover my living expenses. She also said that ‚Äú You just can‚Äôt be my friend unless you work for me‚Äù. Later that same day her assistant gives me my therapist's number and tells me to text her. I did and I received several voice messages, this time saying that she wants me to be the head of her pet therapy department instead and if I don‚Äôt take the job I am ‚Äústupid‚Äù. She also said that she has ‚Äúa lot of money for me‚Äù and ‚Äúmy parents will never see the bill‚Äù.

When I was 10, my mum had an argument with my aunt, and I never saw my extended family again. I did not even recieve any birthday cards or messages from them. I was a very lonely teen and missed them so much. I presumed they didn't love me, in reality they probably didn't want any contact with my mum. My mum can be difficult.

It's been twenty years and I tried to make myself feel better by reasoning that anyone that could cut off a child like must be an awful person. Then recently, my gran died. I was not told about the funeral arrangements. I found my cousin on social media and saw that she had a great relationship with our gran and that our gran had loved her dearly, which really hurt.

I contacted my cousin and told her that I want to reconnect with my extended family and that whatever my mum had done had nothing to do with me, but my cousin doesn't want anything to do with me. She said that my gran never stopped loving me, and blamed me for losing contact with her (I was a child, and thought they had cut off contact with my mum AND me.)

I know this isn't a huge thing to be upset about, but I feel abandoned all over again and it feels so unfair. I missed out on growing up with family. I don't want to contact them again as it feels like begging at this point.

After seeing him for awhile, I had a bad intuitive feeling about him. It's hard to put my finger on it, but he seemed flirty and a little inappropriate at times. I stopped seeing him.

I finally saw her the other day and she told me that she and the therapist have fallen in love and are now in a relationship. Living together! And considering getting married! She's obviously not still seeing him for therapy, because she sees him every day. 

I'm shocked. As she was telling me this, I stayed pretty neutral and just asked questions. I felt kind of speechless. She's had some serious mental health issues in the past. She needs actual care, not whatever the hell this is. It sounds like she's living in secret and has not really told anyone because no one would approve. I'm worried that she's really isolated. I told her that I feel like this relationship is inherently abusive and that this is such an ethical breach.

This year, just a month ago, I was going through something absolutely devastating and earth shattering, and the lack of social support due to the pandemic has made it really hard for me to find my bearings again and get the energy I needed to recover.

Today I had a call with doctor #2 and he blew my mind in the short talk we had. THIS IS HOW IT‚ÄôS SUPPOSED TO FEEL (at least in my mind). I felt so strongly about the points he made and everything resonated so well with what was in my mind.

Don‚Äôt know when it started but i vividly remember the last time, she shamed me into thinking it was all my fault. So my entire childhood I thought I was ashamed and thought I was the abuser ( beyond fucked up I know) I think part of me died in my childhood and will never come back. 

2 years ago I finally came out with the abuse and told my parents about it. They have a hard time dealing with it and I got the feeling they pick her side ( she is doing all the funerals/ family events / I have basically become an outcast in the family as I try to avoid everyone who I associate with her) although I am sure my parents believe what happened. I am often angry at my parents as a proxy for being angry at my sister. I know this is not fair to them but that is just what is happening. This come up often in the different therapies that I had. My sister has never acknowledged anything to.I have very unhealthy revenge feelings to her, they are not violent but more focused on telling the whole world what happened. Very often I contemplate writing a Facebook post about what happened. I don‚Äôt do it because I respect my parents to much.

Last year the pain became to big,  I wrote a suicide note and was ready to kill myself but my roommate found out about the suicide note and after a call to the Docter I had to go to a mental hospital for like nearly 2 months. Where they finally gave me anti depressants and they managed my pain and depression. I finally admitted the shame to them because during therapy when we talked about shame I would dissociate and get flashbacks to those memories. After my stay in the hospital I thought I could move on and finally start my life again.

But after a time I notice that something‚Äôs heal very slow ( avoiding my family, relationship with my parents, depression, suicidal thoughts). I have been trough a lot of therapy and therapists in my life but they all tell me that this is going to take a long time. And I feel like I have no patience in playing the long game to heal. Sometimes I feel that my current life is going to be as good as it is gonna get.

The last few weeks I have kinda been seeing some girl ( she was a music therapist) and we have been really hitting it off. Like I finally felt like someone understands me and our talks where really good. Felt excited for a girl which were feelings I haven‚Äôt had in a long long time. Also scared me a lot. 

However last Sunday she told me I was very affected by my trauma and that as a therapist she will have to find a good way to balance everything. I was very careful not to share to much about my trauma to her as I didn‚Äôt want her to become my therapist. But after reflecting back I realised that maybe I was more searching for someone who could heal me then I was looking for a relationship. So On Tuesday she told me not to date anymore. I am completely lost right now and I feel like every inch of happiness gets stolen from me because of this trauma. 

I have been trough so much therapy and I feel like I won‚Äôt get any better then this. Which for me isn‚Äôt an acceptable level. 
- I am completely alianated from my family. 
- Depressions come and go. It is always waiting for the next wave. 
- I never got an apology which is probably what frustrates me the most. The feeling of injustice is very high. However all therapist said it would be a bad idea to talk with her as it is far from sure she will ever apologise. As they can‚Äôt predict how I will react if I talk with her and she doesn‚Äôt apologise. However there is a lot of pressure from my parents to go and talk with her.

Then she asked me if I had had unprotected sex after that test. I told her no. That was a lie. I did. I slept with a girl a few times after doing the test and before meeting my now-girlfriend.

I have only recently over the past year or so have finally been feeling more secure, able to build some savings but of course I‚Äôm still weary of losing it all again (especially on my mind due to the pandemic)

I have been seeing this therapist for a few months and have been often frustrated with my pay at work because I had to take on a lot more responsibilities over the past 8 months that are not in my job description. They knew how frustrated I was because I brought it up quite often.

I finally! got a raise last week and I was/am so excited. It is not that significant of a raise, far from life changing, and I still have 50k in student loan debt to chip away at (which they know).

I was so excited to tell them about my raise at the beginning of our session and they did say congratulations, that they are happy for me. Then basically immediately said ‚ÄúThis can be a discussion, but let‚Äôs talk about raising the cost for these sessions since you did just get a raise‚Äù

I was so taken aback because I immediately felt like I am just income for them, that their eyes turned to money signs when I said I got a raise. I let them know Id have to look at my budget and talk with my partner. 

And again, I totally understand...their work is so important and just like I‚Äôve been frustrated with my pay, they are entitled to be as well. We agreed on a cost a few months ago, and although it was a bit high for me even then, I agreed because I was in a really bad spot mentally.

UPDATE: So I got lucky and found a board meeting from last year in which she was trying to get her license back. It was revoked due to 9 criminal charges due to: forgery, being a caretaker and doing forgery or embezzlement of funds, driving without a license, driving under the influence, possession of meth, illegal bookmaking for bets, and disturbing the peace.

mzk8pe,therapy,1619514252.0,"So, I have been going to a therapist for a whopping two sessions (I know, yay me, I really tried), and something that's occurred to me is that none of it is real. 

Like, when you have a physical problem, you go to the doctors and they help you using the power of science. Therapy doesn't seem like science to me. It feels more like just aimlessly wobbling around with a broken leg until wow it just magically gets better one day. 

Cynicism aside, I really do want to stop feeling like I'm at the mercy of my own brain. Like, I just don't understand how talking about the fact that I feel like I want to cry is going to help me from not wanting to cry in the future. Is it just for coping then?? Is therapy like antibiotics where it just helps the symptoms sometimes but not the real problem? That's what mental health meds feel like to me. I wanted therapy to be the cure. 

I feel very hopeless honestly. I want to get better. Getting to the point where I made a therapy appointment was huge. And now I just don't feel like I'm cut out for it. I open up a zoom camera and put on some happy go lucky business professional facade and proceed to say all the things you are supposed to say in public about mental health. I know this isn't going to help me. And I know this is the only way I know how to talk to other human beings. So what do I do from here?

I have an intense fear of authority. Which is pretty ironic when trying to talk to someone who's much older and medically qualified. My previous experience with talking with school counselors was traumatic and to put it simply, bad. So now I don't feel like talking to people about things. I don't like to burden people. I don't want my feelings rubbing off on everyone around me. 

Therapy was the last thing I said I'd try before simply throwing the towel. I know I only went for two sessions. The third session I just couldn't get up from bed. Now I'm too nervous to email my therapist saying I don't feel like making this next meeting too.

Wow. I just had a series of like ten different emotions writing this. 

Isn't therapy just you helping yourself? I've been trying that for my whole fucking life. I just need some relief. I can't keep feeling like I'm being tortured by my mind. 

As someone who has no idea what they are doing in this world, I'm asking for some advice. Do I continue therapy? Is there anything else I can do? How long until I can stop feeling like shit? 

I don't feel anything from it. My therapist asked if it helped and I lied and was like ""yes I feel much better! Much less anxious!"" like what was a supposed to say? No?? Like damn now I have to wonder about the social rules and social cues while going through it and pretty soon wow it's exactly like I'm talking to my boss at work. Maybe my problem is that I'm a compulsive liar when it comes to wanting to make others feel better. 

Because the therapist is a person. I need to treat them kindly. And treating people kindly does not include pouring all my trauma and anxieties onto them. I don't get any of this. It doesn't make sense to me at all. It feels like a self help scam or something. 

Fuck I don't know. I just want to get better and I don't know how.

laurql,therapy,1612270242.0,"I have had my current therapist for about a year and a couple of weeks ago I realized that she never really helped me solve any problems. So I looked for a new therapist and planned on switching.

Then last week for the first time we managed to actually work on one of my problems. She asked me how I felt about it and made concrete suggestions on how to procede and I though that was good. Just now I was making coffee and it suddenly hit me: she was just helping herself.

The problem we worked on was my fear about spending money. Basically for the last decade I was always on the brink of having nothing. I was in debt, struggled to pay my bills and grocery shopping became hard to impossible around the 20th of every month. Now I'm a litlle bit better of, but I am still afraid to spent more than I absolutely have to. That includes buying a webcam for video therapy sessions. My therapist already told me that she would not be able to get paid by my insurance for phone therapy for much longer. Essentially, if I don't buy that webcam, she will have a financial loss because of it.

I just realized that this is the reasson she was suddenly willing and able to actually work on a problem with me. Usually she says stuff like: that's part of your diagnosis, you will have acccept that, many people feel like that etc. Basically cheap excuses for not working on the problem, or even on working on me comming to terms with a problem that can't be solved.

I'm pretty pissed right now about wasting a year of therapy on the selfish, useless.... let's just say person. I will be talking to my insurance provider about switching therapists and I will confront my therapist about why she suddenly can help me, just when she would be affected by not doing so.

I will also look into reporting her, allthough I am unsure if that is even possible. Maybe it's just in my mind that a doctor who refuses to help patients, but just strings them along to get paid by their insurance is a fraud.

I was in therapy for 5 years. It was a lady in her late 60's and she charged me less than a third of what the average cost of a session would be in my country at the time for the same amount of time. She was of very little help if not none. It was the same as talking to a friend, she would give me some advise but in the long run it wasn't helpful at all. Also as she was old and I went between the ages of 14 to 19, I needed to explain a lot of things related to social media and new generation stuff. And the worst part was, she used to fall asleep!!!!! Back then I thought that what I was going through wasn't that important and I just bored her. 

Short before I turned 20 I realized I needed a change. I was going through a very strong depression and I decided to go to a psychiatrist because I thought I needed ""a bigger help"" since therapy wasn't working. That was when I found out what therapy is really about. I'm currently on psychiatric treatment and she recommended me another psychologist. Today I had my second session and I can tell you that it has already helped me way more than those 5 years with that old lady.

Original Post Below:

Finding a therapist was super intimidating for me at first and when I was extremely depressed, figuring out how to find a therapist was next to impossible.

Now that I'm in a better place, I really enjoy helping people find the help they need by clearing away the confusing parts about therapy specialties, insurance, etc, etc. I'm a 26-year-old man who has gone through the therapist search process a handful of times personally and for several friends. It's a rewarding way to give back and I'd like to think I'm good at it by now. To be clear, I don't have any kind of medical degree/license-- I actually work in IT. You can stay anonymous during our conversations, but as a rule, I will keep anything you tell me confidential.

Our process will look something like this:

1. Search for therapists with your criteria (insurance/no insurance, male/female therapists, geographic distance, etc)
2. Put a list of potential therapists together
3. Leave a bunch of voicemails (don't worry, we'll do a bunch together or I can tell you what you need to say)
4. Wait for callbacks and schedule first appointments

DM me two or three sentences about you and if I have the time, I'll reach back out.

oz2cqi,therapy,1628237383.0,"Today it felt very real. The realness felt so heavy. Depression really sunk in and it felt like I was wearing a lead suit. I spent most of my day on the couch trying to distract myself from the weight with Netflix. It was hard to cry today, which is abnormal for me. When I would start, I would stop quickly and just feel empty. Grief is exhausting. 

I decimated my sink today too. I pick my skin as a coping mechanism, which is better than my previous go to's, but not good for me to do still. It was something I was going to work on with my therapist and see if the EMDR would help, but we didn't get that far. 

I listened to the first recording he sent me this afternoon. I couldn't do the meditation but I just wanted to hear his voice. I turned my little Bose speaker up as loud as it goes and let the soothing bass tones of his voice wash over me like ocean waves. 

I listened to my favourite recording he sent me later in the evening when I was brave enough to finally have a soak in the tub. The bathtub is my safe haven space, but I've been scared to be alone in the water for the past 2 nights. I really needed the soak as my body has started seizing up from not moving as much as usual. I have a lot of injuries I have to stay on top of with daily mobilization exercises. It's so hard for me to do these when I'm not in a good place. I just don't want to be with myself and feel everything linked to the injuries. This was also something I was supposed to work on with my therapist. 

The recording I listened to tonight really emphasized just what an amazing human this person was. He took the time to make a 25 minute recording just for me. I'm probably the only person who has ever listened to it. In it, he leads me through a relaxation exercise that he adjusted based on something I had mentioned in a previous session about what worked for me. Then he guides me to go to a safe space and to meet myself as a child, which we called ""Little L"". I burst into tears realizing that this was the one that was just for me and that he uses the name for my childhood self. He tells me to sit with Little L and guides me to listen to her and comfort her and give her everything she needs. I've been working on learning how to love myself for many years now, but this journey he has taken me on is everything I have needed to truly get there. I will always cherish this recording that he made just for me and hold it close to my heart. He will always be a part of me and I will hold on to this to help me get through. I am so incredibly grateful to have known him.

oiigu6,therapy,1626058249.0,"I read and respond to a lot of posts here. And I‚Äôve been in hundreds of hours of therapy, with over a dozen therapists.

I see a theme that repeats itself: the charged personal feeling towards the therapist.

This can be a desire to know the therapist cares about you, a feeling of missing them if they go on vacation, curiosity about their other patients, wanting to be special, sexual feelings (but doesn‚Äôt have to be), or any other focused attention on the therapist and their relationship with you.

It also can look like being afraid what the therapist thinks about you, wanting the therapist to view you in a certain light, etc. Any kind of being over involved in the therapist‚Äôs experience.

I have had all types of transference, erotic and otherwise. I know what all of this feels like most intimately. I want to say a couple things:

1. It‚Äôs completely normal. Anything from not giving a fuck about your therapist to wanting to fuck them is normal. Don‚Äôt beat yourself up for whatever feelings come up.

2. You can‚Äôt (and shouldn‚Äôt try to) control the feelings, but you can control the narrative that springs up around them. So, if your heart skips a beat when you see your therapist, you can tell yourself that an intimate context like therapy naturally brings up such feelings. Or you can tell yourself that your therapist is special and you must be in love. That narrative choice is yours.

3. Choose narratives that decrease the personal importance of your therapist in your life. Your therapist is a professional you‚Äôve hired to help you, and while all the feelz are natural, they don‚Äôt have a personal role in your life. The less you cling to your therapist in your head and spend time worrying about your relationship, the more able you‚Äôll be to get real therapeutic work done.

I hope this helps someone because it took me a long time to learn but I feel like my therapy is so much more productive.

jdg1p7,therapy,1603026492.0,"He works at one of the few therapy clinics in my area that offers free therapy ( for those who qualify like me) I told him about my much older coworker constantly staring at my body, accidentally touching me, and constantly in my work area instead of his own. One day, my coworker for some reason thought it was ok to grab my ass as he was walking by. He of course did this while no one else was around. He said it was accident and that he was falling. He obviously just needed to grab my ass to keep his dumb face from hitting the ground. 

As a someone who experienced csa from age 6 to 18, this deeply bothered me. I went into the bathroom and cried until a customer came through the drive through. None of my other co workers knew and I just tried to concentrate on work. 

The next day I had my weekly appointment with my therapist. I told him about what happened and he did agree with me that my coworker sounded predatory especially considering that I‚Äôm 19 and he‚Äôs 40+. My therapist told me that the best thing I can do is just wear baggier clothes so I don‚Äôt tempt him. I already wear baggy clothes to work but I‚Äôm pretty curvy so you can still see my body. I told him that I can‚Äôt change how my body looks in clothing and he just wouldn‚Äôt understand. I‚Äôm just really upset about this and don‚Äôt even know if I even want to schedule another appointment with him. But that means that I will have to look for another therapist and I don‚Äôt know if I can find one who can see me for free or low cost again.

EDIT: I put this in a comment but because it adds context to the convo I had with my therapist I decided to add it to the post: 

I did tell my therapist at the time that what he was saying bothered me. He told that he used to be a therapist for sex offenders and he know how there minds worked. He said that they look for any sign that you might want the attention which is why he told me that I need to wear baggier clothes to not tempt the coworker. That when I replied saying that I can‚Äôt control how my body looks and I already wear baggy clothes to work. The conversation ended there. I never felt like he said it to be malicious, he is a man close to his 60‚Äôs so I feel like he just has an old school mindset. Which is why I decided I‚Äôm not going to report him but I don‚Äôt think he would be a good therapist for me. I experienced sexual abuse for most of my childhood and I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd feel comfortable opening up to him about those parts of my life because I don‚Äôt want another response like this",https://www.reddit.com/r/therapy/comments/jdg1p7/i_told_my_therapist_that_my_coworker_felt_me_up/,"I told my therapist that my coworker felt me up, he told me to wear baggier clothes.

icmkc8,therapy,1597839618.0,"Joined talkspace about 3 + months ago only because my job was offering a discount benefit and I was in the process of losing my job and insurance and need to use my FSA before it was taken away.

I needed to talk to someone during the transitional period and basically poured my heart out to this person ‚Äî sharing my unresolved emotional issues related to feeling worthless and alone. In response I‚Äôd received really shallow responses and vague platitudes and statements like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm glad your comfortable sharing that with me tell me more‚Äù or ‚ÄúYour‚Äôre doing a great job, I see real opportunity here‚Äù. ....Wait what??1? These are the type of replies I‚Äôd receive to ‚Äòhelp‚Äô me once or twice a day, so like every 12 hours.

How the F*ck does this help someone? The only time the Social Worker seemed to be engaged was over Video chat and only when we talked about my job performance over Video chat. He kept pushing me to be optimistic when in reality my situation wasn‚Äôt optimistic at all ‚Äî- and I gave him hard evidence to the contrary to make it simple for this man to understand I was in trouble at work. Either (1) he wan‚Äôt listening, (2) wasn‚Äôt equipped to help me, or (3) he was trained to say optimistic things to all patients in hopes their reality would magically change (which is silly fantastical thinking). In the end, the best thing about him was he was somewhat responsive (low bar of expectation, I know). So I decide to quit Talkspace, however I still have FSA money left over and Talkspace offers be $150 to stay ‚Äî and an additional week, and additional complementary Video chat time....so I take it (giving them one last try)

The day I lost my job I switched to a psychologist- this person didn‚Äôt respond for over 2 days, so I switched to another psychologist and specifically stated - ‚ÄúI had not had the best time working with help here on Talkspace, please tell me what‚Äôs the best way to work with you so I can properly set my expectations and have better outcomes‚Äù. This was on a Friday morning, he doesn‚Äôt respond for over 24 hours. Suddenly it‚Äôs Saturday, so I don‚Äôt expect a response til Monday, but to my surprise this guy reply‚Äôs to me over the weekend with a long message introduction encouraging me to think it will be better this time around. I reply on Monday, he replies on Tuesday with an audio message, I replay back on Thursday with an audio message....then it‚Äôs dead silent for 1 1/2 weeks - he relies back saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry I didn‚Äôt reply there was a storm and we were out of power, but boy am I glad to be back!‚Äù ...Wait what???...how am I supposed to respond to this....he didn‚Äôt even acknowledge my last message. I haven‚Äôt replied back in a week to see if he would acknowledge my last message and as of now it‚Äôs been another 1.5 weeks without him engaging. IM DONE.

F*CK Talkspace - it‚Äôs unaccountable unmoderated overly expensive garbage. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY with Talkspace. You will not get the help you need.  You‚Äôd be better of calling a SUICIDE HOTLINE for FREE (even if your not suicidal) and get better help than trusting this ‚ÄòTECH COMPANY‚Äô.

My next step is to work on some self-directed activities like reading book, completing some journaling exercises, and meditation.....but, eventually I will need to talk to someone. Moral of story, ‚ÄòTech‚Äô is not a suitable replacement for traditional in-person interaction, especially when we are vulnerable and need expert mental health assistance.

UPDATE: Wow. I didn‚Äôt expect this post to get as many upvotes as it did ‚Äî- I just woke up yesterday morning needed an outlet to vent. I hope others can use my experience with Talkspace as a reference and proceed with caution.  Also, a poster below brought to my attention a recent NYTimes article deep diving into the business at Talkspace...what I read did not surprise me the least. Summary: they appear to be capitalizing off of people‚Äôs fears ‚Äî using coronavirus, Trump to push up their subscriber base, they don‚Äôt use AI but they are looking into using AI, they give preference to their large customer accounts e.g. Google employees get higher priority and better response rates form therapists and additional resources like outsourced therapists, they mine transcripts to improve their marketing strategy, therapists‚Äô pay is incentivized on ‚Äòengagement‚Äô ‚Äî therapists get paid more by either increasing respones or simply typing more words in a given response...so I‚Äôm pretty sure the longer these therapists drag on an interaction throughout time without addressing your problem directly the more they get paid in the long term.

The first time I ever had sex, it was a random guy who asked if he could sleep at my couch because he missed the last bus home after a party. I was very drunk. When we got home, it became obvious he wanted sex. I wanted it at first, because I had never had sex and wanted to experience it. Before it started I asked him ""you will stop if I tell you, right?"" and he agreed. I was shivering the whole time. It hurt like shit and bleeded a lot. Then I asked him to stop, which he did for a few minutes, then started again. He had not once asked my consent.

So basically this event is stored in my mind as ""oh well it is my own fault for getting so drunk / not saying ""no"" clear enough / inviting him into my house / not noticing his intentions"" as well as ""it was only sex, nothing too bad"". But now my therapist has called it rape, which I find a very serious word. It is now constantly in my head, even though before I told my therapist I never thought twice about what happened.

mc48kq,therapy,1616588328.0,"I mean as you read in the title, it's only my fault if I feel like this.

I'm a 26yo female and I'm a couple years late with my university studies. I've always been a huge procrastinator, but I've always done my duty (last minute). Until few years ago.

The first years of uni went okay, even though I felt the baggage was too much for me and the things I choose to study were different from what I expected and way too much for me. But again, I did everything I had to for the first 3 years. Then, when I started the last 2 years, I started going slower and slower...""I don't like this exam/this is too difficult for me, if I take it in the next session I'll get a higher grade""...until I started not actually doing exams but just procrastinating them. I mean, the last time I did one was like during summer 2019. So a very long time ago. (I don't blame covid bc as you see the problem started way earlier. Covid just made it worse)

I'm obv experiencing a huge study block and an existential/identity crisis. I feel miserable and anxious, I'm questioning all my life choices and at this point and I don't even know nothing about my future job, I also feel incompetent and useless and a prisoner of my negativity. My self esteem has always been a bit low but not THIS low. I'm negative all the time and I can't find ONE thing I'm proud of about myself. I feel shitty and miserable all the time. I hate myself...even for hating myself. I spend my days procrastinating things I have to do (my only activity is using social media on the phone), and when I don't feel bad or sad I simply feel nothing, I'm completely apathetic, a passive spectator of my own life. I worry too much about what other people think of me, and I compare my useless life to theirs.

My gf is very supportive but she (like my friends) unfortunately can't solve my problems for me. At first my parents were angry with me but they're supportive anyway. They're concerned for me. They're generous enough to pay therapy for me, hoping it helps. I have all these people in my life and I don't even deserve their love. I started T a couple months ago and it's nice to talk with someone from the outside. My T often tells me that there's hope, that I have plenty of options and I can surely find again the strength I once had, by being more positive and disciplined; that my current situation is more common than I think. ""You don't have past trauma or a disfunctional family, or depression. Everyone is here to support you. Yours is a common situation, you can make it if you want to."" She once said that it just seems an ""adjustment disorder with depressed mood"". She said this kinda casually, I don't even think it was a real diagnosis. She then said I can try serotonergic drugs for some time (like less strong and not addictive antidepressant with little side effects). I think I will.

My mental state is caused by this long lasting (self induced) stressful situation of nothingness that my life is. This is not a real mental condition, this is not for example depression I have just because of genetics or trauma in my life. I caused my suffering with my own hands. I DECIDED to be this miserable, with poor choices day by day. I DECIDED to be lazy, every day, for years. As I said, I've always been a huge procrastinator. My mom since I was really young has always told me ""You can't be like this forever, it will be a bigger problem in the adult world"", that always pissed me off because I was like ""What do you want I'm even good at school this is just the way I function"" no this is not. And she was right. This is not the way I function. This has never been. This is just a terrible habit I've always had, and now it's 1000 times harder to change. Because I'm an adult. Because I failed, and I feel like it's not worth it anymore. I really can't find motivation.

With my T I sometimes tend to belittle my emotions. I'm usually honest, but I try to be rational and down to earth when I describe how I feel. I don't want everything to sound worse than it actually is, because I'm always wondering if my mind is the problem. I mean, maybe I'm just making a big deal out of a totally normal situation? Should I just stop complaining, force myself to somehow do my last exams without thinking about my regrets of the past and anxiety for the future? But it does not seem easy. Or am I just whiny? Or am I faking all this ""suffering"" in order to feel less guilty? I know nothing anymore

¬† I'm probably going to dance around the details of a certain part because I'm ashamed of it, but here we go. When my stepmom first moved into our house, I didn't like her. I was about 6 then. I mostly didn't like her because she made me do chores, but that's expected.

¬† When I was 8, I started really missing my mom. I tried to talk to my stepmom about it, but she just got angry. She told me that my mom left because she was irresponsible and didn't love me. She'd say that every single time I'd try to tell her how I felt.

  I had this little ""diary"" thing since 2nd grade. My stepmom found it during one of her room-searches. I had a few ""disturbing"" things written in it. I was sent to therapy for it.

¬† Here's where the embarrassing part is. I'm so sorry. Please don't hate me. I was 10 years old. Covid had just started, and I hadn't seen my one friend in a while. She's basically my sister, she's the only person I felt like I could talk to. Anyways, I wanted to find a way to talk to people, and that's how I found chatrooms. I decided to be stupid. Several people would ask for pictures of me, and I'd send them. I didn't think anything bad was happening. 

  I thought those people actually cared about me. My dad barely talked to me, it was getting obvious my stepmom didn't like me, my grandparents let me do anything, and never talked to my mom. I just wanted to feel like someone cared. Still, it's my fault. I shouldn't have ever talked to those people.

  I found Vocaloid. It's still one of the things that help calm me down. My stepmom and dad think it's evil, though. 

  Then I found porn. Please don't hate me. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I was 10. It had to be puberty or something, right? Am I just stupid?

  I was in homeschool. I had been moved out of my old room so my half-brothers could be put in mine. My new room was the laundry room. I did my schoolwork in there. I hate this. I'm sorry. My stepmom came into the room in the middle of. I'm sorry. I can't type it. I hate it. I'm so sorry. Please don't hate me.

  She took away any privacy I had. I wasn't allowed to see my friends or grandparents. I couldn't do anything but schoolwork and punishments. I had this little house phone. When she was asleep, I grabbed it and ran outside. I called my mom and told her I was going to visit her. She called my dad. He came home. That's all I can remember. That was my 2nd time trying to run away. Nobody knew it.

  That's where the big part started. I was miserable. It was winter. They told me to stay outside several times. They made me take cinder blocks from the house to the barn. They'd tell me I couldn't eat until I apologized. I was too scared to. My dad eventually made her let me eat. I broke a vase on accident while I was cleaning. She yelled at me to come to her. She grabbed my throat and shoved me onto the wall. Nobody believed me. My dad knew, but he never stood up for me. They made me empty the shed, clean the barn, and dig a random hole in the yard and fill it back up.

  I was so sad. I genuinely wanted to die. My dad came down to me while I was digging the hole. He asked if I lived with my mom would I be happy again. Around 8 PM he came back and told me to come to the fire with him. He told me we were going to the mental hospital. They didn't take me. The next day, my dad told me he was going to call my mom to take me with her. It was all I ever wanted, so why couldn't I just be happy? Just for once. It's all my dad ever wanted for me. He was giving me up so I could be happy. Why? I love him. I hurt him. I think I'll text him. I'll apologize.

  I started homeschool at my mom's. I got distracted. I played Genshin instead of school. I was failing. I made my mom sad. My dad called in June. He said time was up and I was coming home. It wasn't home. He'd moved away from my friend and grandparents. I still had to go. I've never cried as hard as I did then. I had my mom, and now she was being taken away again. Why.

  When I got there, my stepmom told me to kill myself. I told my dad. He said I was lying so I could go back to my mom. The next day she flipped me off and told me to kill myself again. She spent that whole week flipping me off and telling me to kill myself.

  I asked him what he'd do when he figured out I was telling the truth. He said he'd divorce her. She told him I said I was going to kill her. He called the police. They sent me back to the hospital. I stayed there. I felt like I was dying. When I came home, I couldn't move. I wouldn't let go of my Pooh Bear. I'd just lay there and cry. He had to force me to get up and eat. I had made my own language just so I could write without him being sad. I'm so sorry.

  He figured out she was lying. He made her apologize. I said I forgave her. The next day I was back with my mom permanently. I'm a jerk to my little brother. I haven't seen my dad in a year. I haven't seen my grandparents in 5 months. I haven't talked to my friend in 4 months. I'm losing everything. They're all dying.

  Then I thought that maybe nobody else is real. It makes everything worse, but I barely notice it.

  Now here I am. Crying at 3 AM. Listening to robots. Yelling at nobody. I know something's wrong. I'm on medication. But I'm just 13. I keep thinking that it's just because of my age. Everyone keeps telling me something is wrong. I know. I know. Just help me. I'm going to die. It's going to happen. I'm going to die. Just a few more years and then it'll be ok.

jvmbub,therapy,1605586341.0,"I just want to say that I participated in a free therapy program for therapists getting their degree this year and it was such a great experience that I‚Äôm so grateful for. 

The local university offers free therapy for locals based on a first come first serve basis. These are therapists working to get their degree and need the hours in order to complete it. I was very skeptical but also excited at the prospect of free therapy for a few months. With my EAP, I could almost afford a weird conglomeration of therapy for a full year.

I may have lucked out but my therapist was amazing. We clicked right away. I thought the fact that they were the same age as me and inexperienced would be weird, but it all turned out perfectly.

I reached out to the university program based on a referral from my boss (the HR Director!) I missed the deadline for 2019 and so I put it in my calendar for 2020 and plan to do the same next year...although I‚Äôd be surprised if I‚Äôm that lucky again. 

My therapist always remembered our previous discussions, she compassionately validated my feelings while also challenging them. She gave me tools and advice. She shared in my joy and pain. 

I contacted the program due to some childhood trauma, depression and also cleanliness. We focused on topics in each session that were on my mind but she always made sure to bring it back to my goals.

I will say, we started out in person and moved to virtual. Our sessions were recorded and viewed by their professor either way. I thought that would make me uncomfortable but I just put it out of my mind. Our in person sessions were definitely better and it was easier to focus, but the zoom ones were great too since we had already established a relationship. 

Our sessions ended about 6 months ago. I loved our sessions but I wasn‚Äôt really sure if they changed me at all.

So I just want to say that cleaning was almost always a  negative experience in my childhood. Not to get into the details but I do realize how bad it was now and why I have an aversion to it. 

Anyway, I had a thought yesterday - I have been able to keep my place ‚Äúsatisfactory‚Äù for the last 6 months+. Sure, I‚Äôve had a few weeks where things get a little out of control, but nothing to the extent of before my therapy.

And you know what? I think a lot of it was due to my therapy with this ‚Äústudent‚Äù. Being able to talk to someone about it and just have them validate my feelings made me feel more empowered to deal with it. I know I‚Äôm not ‚Äúcured‚Äù but I feel stronger in my abilities.

In conclusion, I miss her and secretly hope that I will find her when she‚Äôs licensed and be able to see her again, even though I know that‚Äôs probably not likely.

In short, try every avenue available to you! And also!

Up until today she has been great and I have been finding the EMDR to be pretty helpful, but lately my depression has been creeping back up between fruitless job hunting and the winter blahs, so I‚Äôm finding it hard to get out of bed some days. When I told her about this she was very harsh with me out of nowhere. 

She told me that I need to challenge my depression and ‚Äúlying around not doing anything‚Äù won‚Äôt help me (which was MASSIVELY triggering because my abusive mother frequently accused me of being lazy/incompetent, which has been the subject of many EMDR sessions) and said almost angrily that it seems like the EMDR isn‚Äôt helping me at all. She then accused me of wanting a pill to fix all my problems (I am on antidepressants but never indicated that I‚Äôm expecting them to cure me) and said that I won‚Äôt get better by doing nothing. The thing is, I have been trying everything I can think of to get better (talk therapy, IOP program, EMDR, medication) and seriously prioritizing my mental health the past three years, so feel like I have been doing a lot! I just keep getting stuck. I told her as much but she insisted that I‚Äôm just waiting for something to fix me and asked what I‚Äôm actually doing to help myself. Because of her harsh tone I froze up and couldn‚Äôt think of anything to say and she used my silence to continue driving the point that I‚Äôm not doing enough.

Around 19 he met his birth parents. His father hadn't known about him. His parents had a bit of a fling when they were younger and friends. When his mother told his father years later after reconnecting he insisted on meeting my partner. 

&#x200B;

A bit of history here. My partner has a very expansive sexual history, nothing that he seems ashamed of, bisexuality and lots of sexual partners. He and his ex wife were swingers throughout their marriage and partnership of almost 20 years (They too meet young). He and I met under the pretext of having a casual relationship, and of course that turned into a relationship. 

&#x200B;

He is easily the best man I've ever met, he is kind, he has an incredible heart, he treats me so very well, respects me and I adore his two children. He was not hard to fall in love with. He has been very open about his past and I feel very comfortable being honest with him. 

&#x200B;

Saturday we were at my house drinking a bit, he keeps insinuating there are things if I knew I'd leave him. I keep insisting this is not the case just tell me so I can stop imagining the worst. Well. Yeah He told me. When he had met his birth parents he continued to be in contact with them. I did not ask for details.. but he told me he and his mother had a physical relationship soon after. She was 38 he was 20. I couldn't ask more. I'm destroyed. It's not my issue, it's not my problem but now this is my burden to bear and I cannot tell anyone in my life. My best friend is a therapist, I of course wanted to go to her with this but I can't betray his trust in telling me this and I cannot burden her with this. He explained to me there is a psychological phenomena and that this is not uncommon among people who are reunited with their blood relatives. I cannot wrap my head around it. I don't know if I can be intimate with him again knowing this.. and that ""intimacy"" is really important to me in a relationship. I called a therapy group in the city I live in and await a call back. I need help unpacking this and I've asked that he speak to someone about this.

11 days ago I woke up, kissed his head, and went into the shower. When I was in the shower I was shaving my arms, and all I heard was a gun getting cocked back, a bang, and a loud thud. I literally sat in the shower in shock. I thought somebody was trying to break in and got shot. So I asked him if he was okay. But there was no response: I breathed really heavily, got up out of the shower, and opened the bathroom door.

When I went out I saw his body on the ground in the dark, I instantly freaked the hell out, and I tried to find the gun but I couldn‚Äôt, it was under his body. I tried to put pressure on his head and keep his brains back in his head, and there was matter all over my hands. I called the ambulance, and all that arrived was the cops. 

The cops came in saw my hands and saw me, and they pulled me aside for questioning, but I didn‚Äôt hear anything they were saying. It felt like I was doing acid, everything was unimportant, and wavy. I literally couldn‚Äôt remember anything, besides wanting be held my boyfriend. Begging the universe for another chance. But nothing.

An hour later the coroner came, lazily put his dead body on a gurney, and dragged him out. I was left cleaning up the matter, the shell they left in the room, and a $10 bill.

qyg6k2,therapy,1637446490.0,"I went to therapy to deal with anxiety and depression arising from some health complications that I had been having which reduced my quality of life, so coping has been difficult. 

It was mainly CBT/mindfulness based therapy and honestly it really did nothing for me and I cant even understand why it should work. Some of the things Ive tried in therapy are:

**1. Correcting bad thoughts:**

To give examples. I met with my therapist every week and we talked about my week and negative thoughts/fears/anxieties that I had been having. We did thought catalogues which is used for me to record emotions/bad thoughts that i have and then provide evidence for and evidence against these thoughts and reach a ""balanced"" thought. The idea is that I catastrophize my fears and this will reduce it. But this did nothing for me in terms of reducing my anxiety because it just made me much more focused on the bad thoughts, and my anxiety arise from health uncertainties so the ""evidence for"" and ""evidence against"" just feels like i'm reaching, not based on reality BECAUSE reality is uncertain. So there is no real evidence if my thought is right or wrong.

**2. Mindfulness meditation:**

And then we tried mindfulness meditation to allow myself to view my bad thoughts as outside of myself and to imagine my thoughts floating by and not affecting me. This worked occasionally but I can only do mindfulness meditation when I am like a 3/10 in terms of anxiety. If I am having a panic attack, I literally cannot even sit or sleep let alone sitting still to meditate. I can see this working for people with mild anxiety or very mild depression to allow the mind to wonder for a while. But I really cant see how this can work on a clinical basis.

**3. Behavioral corrections:**

This is about focusing on things you love rather than engaging in negative behaviors that cause the anxiety/depressive feelings. But this doesnt quite make sense to me either. Because it is the anxiety/depression that keeps me FROM doing the things I love in the first place. So its almost circular logic in a way. It's like saying ""the way to cure back pain is to do more back exercise so you dont get back pain"". Like a little too late for that I think.

**In conclusion:**

For me what I believe ACTUALLY works for people detailing with moderate to severe anxiety/depression is honestly just medication, not therapy. My father had depression and his family physician immediately prescribed him with prozac and he was literally cured after a year. He never felt suicidal ever again after that. It also worked alot for some of my friends as well. I think yes, there are side effects, so its really important to get a GOOD family phyisican or psychiatrist to help you choose the correct medication/dosage for you. And yes, the ween off process can be difficult, but its the best PROVEN cure we have.

I haven't taken any anti-depressants mostly due to my current health complications. But I find that caffeine really works for me. It almost seems counterintuitive that caffeine should work for anxiety, but for some reason it does for me. I think its because it stimulates me and I feel happier and more engaged as result, and that allows me to focus less on the bad thoughts/feelings. With caffeine I am able to actually feel happy enough to engage in my hobbies and activities that make me happy. Another thing I really believe works is intensive physical exercises. Just forcing yourself to run on a treadmill for 30 mins everyday after a couple of weeks, can really work. And the REASON why it works is because when you have mental illness, you have imbalance of chemicals in the brain, ITS AN ILLNESS. So no amount of ""correcting"" your thinking patterns is going to help, because YOUR BRAIN IS THE PROBLEM. So you have to have outside stimulants such as exercising (release endorphins), antidepressants, caffeine, other drugs, etc. that would actually help re-balance the chemicals in your brain. There are other things such as valerian root, passionflower, etc. that I heard can help but I havent tried yet. 

**TL;DR:** I believe that CBT/mindfulness based therapy only helps for people with very mild anxiety/depression, for people who dont have an actually difficult circumstances to overcome, but just mild unhappiness, could potential help. But for moderate/severe people its not even remotely possible to be cured with therapy, and only outside stimulants can helps to rebalance the chemicals in your brain (i.e. antidepressants, intensive exercise, caffeine, other alternative herbal medications).

So now I've started to realise that what she said kind of stuck with me. I Constantly feel like I'm manipulating people if I ask for things or that I‚Äôve tricked them into liking me. 

A couple examples are when I went for my job interview, I couldn't tell if they liked me or not, but then they offered me the job at the interview. Instantly I felt that I had somehow deceived or tricked them into thinking that they liked me and actually wanted to hire me. 

Another is happening now. I've been seeing a therapist and am kind of going through a rough patch, I emailed him last night asking if it would be possible for more frequent sessions.

ir5oca,therapy,1599882999.0,"Hello, 

I‚Äôve been seeing a psychiatrist for about a month and have had two sessions with him. I strictly see him for medication and nothing else, I have a therapist I see more often for the majority of my issues. 

So, during our initial interview he asked me about my diet. I told him I‚Äôm vegan. He told me that lack of cholesterol is directly correlated to anxiety and that I should eat eggs. I told him I will not eat eggs because I‚Äôm vegan. He claims he used to be vegan ‚Äúso he gets it‚Äù. I straight up told him that‚Äôs not happening and had to say it three times in the hour we spoke. 

So today, we had our first follow up. He asked again if I decided to incorporate eggs. I said no, I‚Äôm not going to. He explained the correlation again. I told him I‚Äôm vegan for moral reasons, so even if eating them *did* help with my anxiety, the guilty and anxiety I would feel from eating eggs would just cancel it out. He proceeded to ‚Äúeducate‚Äù me about sustainable back yard chickens. Blah blah blah. I explained to him, again, that I‚Äôve been vegan for 3.5 years and I‚Äôm aware of sustainable options, but I do not wish to consume them. THEN he had the audacity to ask, ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs your boyfriend think about that?‚Äù. Mind you, my boyfriend is also vegan for moral reasons and my psych knows he‚Äôs vegan. I said ‚Äúhe‚Äôs also vegan for moral reasons.‚Äù And left it at that. 

I‚Äôm so annoyed that I‚Äôm spending money to have this conversation. If he tries to talk to me about it again I‚Äôm going to tell him that I‚Äôm not interested continuing out sessions if he‚Äôs going to continue to bring this topic up. 

Has anyone else experienced anything similar to this? Doesn‚Äôt have to be vegan specifically... but a professional asking you to compromise your morals like this?

nla19q,therapy,1622010070.0,"My last two roles were incredibly tough on me. I started my career many years ago now as a graduate. I was super ambitious, keen and ready to learn. What I was met with was bullying, sexism, sexual harassment, racism and professional neglect. I spent the first three years incredibly depressed, isolated and ballooned in weight trying to cope with everything.

Some nights my mind goes back to certain teams I was on, a dirty look from a manager, weeks sitting alone in the office, the poor reputation spread about me which cost me opportunities and how I contemplated suicide many times as a young professional in my work toilets. I would spend 10-15 minutes when I could to escape the day because nothing I did was good enough for these people.

I‚Äôll never forget when I thought I had finally found my big break and the manager wrote on my review card I was 0 for everything. I remember working late, sitting in 6 hour meetings and desperately trying to please my team because I wanted to do well. 0 was incompetent. Thank God for a then senior friend who coached me through that time. I had hit rock bottom.

But things got lower for the last time I hoped. I moved to my last role and I thought it would be my fresh start. It was not. The colleague I sat next to wouldn‚Äôt speak to me for some reason, he was so influential that it trickled down to everyone in the team and I was isolated again. Desperate to not have a repeat, I organised team events (despite being new) and no one gave a crap. My manager was OK but would scream at me in the office and I almost broke down again. 

Needless to say I got therapy, out performed and then left for my current role which is so much better. So much!

I had been seeing my therapist ‚ÄúLeo‚Äù for about six months and had made excellent progress, I was very happy with the match up and we made leaps and bounds towards better mental health, boundaries, and healing of complex childhood trauma. Until Last week; Leo began our session by telling me that the way I was dressed was inappropriate and that he was distracted during our session. I was wearing black leggings and a cropped t shirt. My midriff was showing slightly, and i understood how that might be distracting to anyone. But never considered it even remotely inappropriate. At the beginning of the session I agreed to be more mindful of my outfits. Whatever. However, Leo insisted on hammering into me for the rest of my session that his distraction and pre occupation by my clothing choice was not his fault, but my parents fault. When I said that I felt afraid and shamed by him saying this behind a closed door (I have a long history of childhood sexual abuse) that it was not his fault, but my parents for not protecting me and that is why I feel it‚Äôs appropriate to dress provocatively ‚Äúon a daily basis.‚Äù
I hesitated to tell anyone about this because I was so embarrassed, but I told my fianc√©, and my closest friends and relatives. They all pushed me to follow my instincts and cancel further sessions with Leo. I did.

In which she found my older sisters alcohol bottle and tissues with blood on them (from not so healthy coping mechanisms). When I got home, she accused me of drinking and also added on she saw the tissues, and decided she had the right to remove my door.

She went on about her trying to leave me be/have my privacy (she hasn‚Äôt), and she had enough. Mind you, my room can easily be seen from the living room so seriously zero privacy. 

I, obviously with a lack of privacy and upset, pack my things for school tomorrow and some clothes and left. On the way out I was called a brat for not answering her where I was going (I didn‚Äôt want her following me so I didn‚Äôt respond). I‚Äôm currently at a friends house and I‚Äôm feeling shit. All of this has been overwhelming and I‚Äôve made arrangements on going to a friends house after this house as they don‚Äôt know how long they can keep me for. 

I honestly don‚Äôt know what to do though. Talking to her isn‚Äôt on the table as I‚Äôve tried and it doesn‚Äôt get through to her.

She replied saying that' I need a lot of work and that she wants to help me, that I'm messed up and have a lot of work before I can be of use in this world'

My life wasn't perfect, as isn't anyone's but there was no specific reason why I went to therapy. Simply thought I would give it a try to see if anything could be holding me back. I have some anger I would like to sort out, but never considered myself ''messed up'' or ''not of use to the world'.

Ever since she got the idea into me I started telling myself that I am broken and messed up and need a lot of help. Which has put me in a bad space.

Since that session I have some negative associations and reluctance in attending sessions with her any more. She can probably still help me and do some good, but I don't like how what she said made me feel and believe about myself.

My question is, should therapist really tell their clients that their messed up?

FOR EXTRA CONTEXT, the sessions are long but not the whole duration is therapy talk. Anywhere between 30 - 45% would be about random conversations like pets, travelling, life in general and other random things. She says she likes to do that so that her clients get to relax before they properly start on the sessions.

Maybe I do benefit from easing into it, but often found it annoying, I find it difficult to be direct and ask her to get back on topic some times as Im afriad to come across as rude.

If you are doing that full time, why aren't you at an agency, your own private practice, or a hospital where you can earn more money? Betterhelp also has really questionable ethics that any professional therapist would seriously question. They actually say in the fine print that the service is not mental health or health care.

He just stayed quiet and I was squirming in my seat, trying to think of something to say but nothing came out. When he wanted to know, what was keeping me from talking, I realized that it was the feeling of being annoying to him, of him having grown tired of me and wanting to get rid of me. I told him and he said, that maybe it seemed to me to be like that because he keeps on asking me questions and because I wouldn't answer he always starts giving me options for answers. He said, that maybe he seemed to be impatient to me. And then he told me, that he only does this, because he wanted to relieve me from the distressing silence (I really feel bad when there's silence).  

Then he wondered how he could make me believe, that he is not annoyed with me and fucking apologized for making me feel this way. That just killed me.

I felt so ashamed and cried and  my heart hurt so much and I didn't say a word till the end of the session. I wanted to disappear, I wanted to be nothing. But I also wanted my therapist to be there for me, to support me and care for me. But I hated myself for that whish and just kept on crying because it occurred to me, that I am such a baby and that I still have a long way to go to be ok.

This may be of interest to anyone who has had or is having cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT).

We are a small group of clinicians and software developers from England, UK, who have spent the last year trying to reduce the drop off rate for people undergoing 6 week programmes of CBT.

We experimented with many different resources to support people undergoing CBT for common issues. We experimented with the usual books, worksheets and apps. Unsurprisingly, different things worked for different people and there was no one size fits all resource or method. This led us to build our own resource to reduce the drop off rates we were seeing. 

Over the course of a year we incrementally built an app for this use case and tested it with over 100 people. We designed it to be used in between therapy sessions to reinforce lessons and help people complete their goals and exercises. Each person gets a weekly email report with a summary of their progress, their mood progression and their most common cognitive distortions. They can choose to share this with their therapist if they like. 

Two things happened that we are pleased with:

1. Not only were we able to reduce drop off rates for the 6 week programme, but we saw much higher levels of engagement during the main programme sessions. 
2. Several of our testers referred their friends to the app, as a way to get introduced to CBT. As a result, we have some early indications that it might be useful as a standalone introductory app, as well as something that can accompany professional therapy. 

Right now we‚Äôre really interested to get any thoughts or feedback on the app and how we can improve it. We‚Äôd be really grateful to hear from some users as well as clinicians if possible. 

It's available on iOS and android and you can get it at ionamind dot com.

Ever since I was a baby I have always been very distrusting of others. I never wanted to talk to my teachers, when my friends' parents ( if I was able to make friends) were about to leave and my mom told me to say bye I would just look at them, etc. My parents don't think much of it. 

I had an amazing time in school and I was making astounding grades, but that all changed in 5th grade.

I was dreading this teacher for the whole Summer because I knew the kind of stuff she did to kids. I 4th grade I heard her yelling from across the hall. So many kids wanted to mill themselves in 5th grade.  ( Well, it was a lot for a small private school, anyways.)  I was genuinely scared for 5th grade. But when I walked in the door she was really nice to me. A wave of relief went over me. I thought I would be fine for the whole year!

 I was wrong. Very wrong. I swear she was bipolar. A joke that would make her laugh one day would offend her the next day. She would publically humiliate me in front of the class as well as other kids. Whenever my mom emailed her that I wouldn't be going to school that day, she would get angry and give an F on everything that day. I tried not to miss school that much. But I couldn't! I would have constant anxiety attacks about her. My family didn't have enough money to send me to therapy again (That stuff is expensive!!) so they just tried to give me some more medications.

He and I were talking about the things we thought were worth fighting for. I finally get the courage to do it. We share a kiss in my bed. It was my first real kiss. 

I left out the part where he would turn away whenever I would avoid his touches. I left out the part where I wasn‚Äôt 100% ready when we kissed. I left out the part where I felt uncomfortable when he was touching my breasts. I left out the part where I kissed him because I was scared he would leave if I didn‚Äôt. 

During our dates, he would lean in forward to kiss me. I would dodge him because I was scared. I wasn‚Äôt ready yet. And then it would be days of him giving me the silent treatment. Days where I would stare at my sent messages asking him what‚Äôs wrong. Days of silence. Frustration. 

There‚Äôs plenty more instances. My friends used to tell me he gaslighted me (I defended him). That he coerced me (I said I liked it eventually). That he made me feel bad for not being ready (I would say I just needed to go out of my comfort zone). That it was manipulation (He would never do that).

But I‚Äôve loved him for the past two years. I told myself he‚Äôs The One That Got Away. I still cry about him to my best friends. Every good thing I‚Äôve accomplished I‚Äôve done with him in the back of my head. 

After it ended, I blamed myself for being too much of a prude. That I wasn‚Äôt game enough with him. That I didn‚Äôt suck his dick when he wanted me to. That I should‚Äôve let him give me head when he wanted to. 

I wrote letters (I never sent them) about wanting to start over and doing it right. Blamed myself for everything bad that happened. I still supported his craft quietly because I told him I believed in him and always will. I strive to get better to be right for him when we meet again. 

And I‚Äôm only realizing now that I may have romanticized the entire relationship to justify the relationship to myself (it was never official). That someone actually cared about me. That the relationship was valid and real.

n3g7bi,therapy,1619990280.0,"So last year May, I was hospitalized for substance abuse at an inpatient psychiatric treatment center. Whilst there, I (19F) met an addictions counselor (37M), and instantly, I felt as though we had a connection. He would leave flirty comments on my assignments, and would seemingly become jealous whenever I would interact with another male patient, and openly disliked my boyfriend at the time.

&#x200B;

After I left the center, we friended one another on social media and began chatting outside of sessions. We started talking on the phone, and the conversation became more mutual and casual. He would often check up on me, and over time, I recognized that I was falling in love with him.

&#x200B;

I was readmitted to another treatment center last year July, a place that I specifically chose because I knew that he worked there once a week. I would anxiously and excitedly wait for this day to arrive and would spend extra time making myself look better, in anticipation of his arrival. We would sit together before and after groups, and have a cigarette together, and talk about what was going on for us. In groups, he began referring to me as his girlfriend and would make a conscious effort to sit next to me. We began saying that we loved each other every time that we saw one another, he commented on my appearance, told me that my hair smelt nice when we would hug, and he began talking about getting ""hard-ons"" etc, which other patients overheard, and commented on. At this point, I had fallen in love with him.

&#x200B;

After leaving treatment again, we began seeing each other over the weekend, where he would pick me up from my house, and later drop me off. We would always spend extra time in his car, and I could almost feel the anticipation in the air, but I would always become awkward and flustered before anything happened, something that he laughed about. We spoke about going out together, but soon after I relapsed, and we stopped talking.

&#x200B;

We recently got back in touch, and I invited him to my apartment with the intention of having sex, but got cold feet at the last moment, as I wasn't entirely sure he felt the same way. About a week ago, my suspicions were confirmed, after I asked him if he would help me break out of my parent's house, to which he responded ""we can first have sex in the car and then run away together""

I had an appointment to go and see my therapist, the day before I came down HARD with a cold. I called my therapists office and tried to cancel, they said if I had called two days ago, they wouldn't have had a problem with me cancelling. But since it was the day before, I would have to pay for half the appointment.

I explained that I was sick and had a temperature of 39¬∞C (103¬∞F) and wasn't able to go. They said they couldn't wave their policy and if I had called two days ago, it would have been fine. I said that that would have been impossible and that I wasn't even sick two days ago!

I remember sitting down in the waiting room shivering.

My therapist comes out and sees me and asks why I'm there if I'm so sick (she could see that I was pale, red cheeks from the temperature and was shivering). I told her to talk to her receptionist and went into the room to start the session out of sheer spite.
I could hear my therapist berating the receptionist and then they came in and apologised and said that I could go home if I wanted and we didn't need to do the appointment if I was unwell.

I was furious and felt like crap and said ""No, I'm here now and we can do it now!"" 

I don't remember what we talked about, I don't remember what they said in advice or whatever. I remember that the receptionist called me the next day to say sorry and that the money I paid had gone back into my account and they apologized for putting me in that situation.

We were in an advanced studies program where students had a limited budget and were allowed to pursue interests that the school couldn‚Äôt teach. I read and corrected his book while doing my own project. Eight years have passed, and I hung out with him and his girlfriends, I tutored him through chemistry, and I gave him rides to physical therapy when he broke his arm in wrestling, and I was at his graduation, despite COVID-19. At his graduation party, I found out he was dating a girl in my graduating class. They seemed good together. They had similar interests, and they had similar personalities.  Not long after, they moved in together in another state. A few months ago, they came back, and I had lunch with them. I never noticed anything out of the ordinary. I just recently found out that he killed her and has been charged with first degree murder. It has been on my mind every second since then. When I cook, clean, walk, drive, it‚Äôs there. When I watch tv or YouTube, the memory makes itself known at random. I feel like I‚Äôve been cycling through the stages of grief since then, with the only constant being my own guilt for not noticing anything. My guilt is even stronger because I talked to some of his exes since then, and apparently he was always abusive. I can‚Äôt seem to decide whether I want to mourn the man I thought he was, or hate the man he is.

Update: For anyone who is curious, and at risk of revealing who the friend is, he has been charged with sexual assault and rape along with first degree murder.

Either way I feel like at times she was bored with our discussions but still listened until i finally started opening up recently. Yesterday she was constantly looking at the clock while i was talking which is fine but also makes me feel rushed. I paid her and she offered me hand sanitizer. 

I was just making small talk as i walked out her room and she walked me out her office and down the corridor to leave until we reached the waiting room and door. I was finishing what i was saying and was about to say goodbye and she snapped "" I have another client coming sorry"" it was very shocking to me because i didnt ask her to a) walk me out and b) I didnt want to just walk silently with her thru the building. I thought it was very uncalled for as she also seemed angry like how dare you speak to me when im not being paid. 

I had a wave of embarrassment wash over me after she did that and i just walked away from her. I was actually so upset that i pulled over crying when driving home. My question is I don't want to see her after this, do i text her my problem or just cancel and never go back?

She still sometimes falls into intense violent rage episodes where there is screaming, hitting, following people around, name calling etc. for hours, but this has become far less common with therapy, meds, and support. 

She has recently accepted she was traumatized and has noticed memories resurface. While in a good mood, she'll open up about these traumas. For example, she'll open up about how an older teen forced her to kiss her when she was way younger and be able to identify this as trauma, but remains in a good mood while recanting these stories.

I've been trying to match her mood while expressing that I'm sorry these things have happened to her so as to not trigger sadness or anger in her. Her dad‚Äîmy husband‚Äîtends to try and quickly change the topic. I  don't know what approach might be best.

Edit: Thank you, everyone, for your guidance. I had a talk with my husband afterwards and later that night. He mentioned that he rushed her out of the conversation because he was trying to get her to go to bed and didn't want her to be thinking about that sort of stuff deeply during that time. To be fair, she does have such bad sleep issues that she's on medication for it. Nevertheless, I expressed that I was worried about her not getting to talk about these things in depth. Sounds like they have had a lot of deep and long  talks about trauma lately which is good! He heard my concerns and is going to open the door to her today about it. 

For me, I can't stress enough how much everyone's guidance helped me, especially on naming the emotion and remaining authentic.

I know that it's easy to get carried away by emotions and mess up therapeutic dynamics by trying to be their friend/trying to impress them/etc. As a result, I've been mindful to uphold therapeutic boundaries, which helps me be fully honest, unfiltered and clear about my thoughts and emotions, knowing that it's a space dedicated to processing them in a structured way without fearing judgment/disapproval. 

My therapist, to their credit, has also been exemplary and has struck the right balance of warm, caring yet impersonal cordiality and empathy when required. Progress has been steady, and I certainly look forward to our sessions every week.

Recently they've had to cancel some sessions because of pandemic related emergencies. They've assured me that they'll accommodate me as soon as possible, which is honestly far from my concerns right now. I obviously understand the situation at hand right now, and don't mind resuming at a more convenient time.

Any sexual or inappropriate contact or comments is illegal and should be reported to the state licensing board immediately. I am including excerpts from California‚Äôs licensing board (BBS) publication ‚ÄúTherapy Never Includes Sexual Behavior.‚Äù

INTRODUCTION

Sexual behavior between a therapist and a client can harm the client. Harm may arise from the therapist‚Äôs exploitation of the client to fulfill his or her own needs or desires, and from the therapist‚Äôs loss of the objectivity necessary for effective therapy. All therapists are trained and educated to know that this kind of behavior is illegal and unethical.

Therapists are trusted and respected by their clients, and it is not uncommon for clients to admire and feel attracted to them. However, a therapist who accepts or encourages the expression of these feelings through sexual behavior with the client‚Äîor tells a client that sexual involvement is part of therapy‚Äîviolates the therapeutic relationship, and engages in conduct that may be illegal and unethical. This kind of abusive behavior can cause harmful, long-lasting, emotional, and psychological effects to the client. 

WARNING SIGNS

In most sexual misconduct cases, other inappropriate behavior comes first. While it may be subtle or confusing, it usually feels uncomfortable to the client. Some clues or warning signs are:

Telling sexual jokes or stories.

Sending obscene images or messages to the client.

Unwanted physical contact.

Excessive out-of-session communication (e.g., text, phone, email, social media, etc.) not related to therapy.

Inviting a client to lunch, dinner, or other social and professional activities.

Dating.

Changing the office‚Äôs business practices (e.g., scheduling late appointments when no one is around, having sessions away from the office, etc.).

Confiding in a client (e.g., about the therapist‚Äôs love life, work problems, loneliness, marital problems, etc.).

Telling a client that he or she is special, or that the therapist loves him or her.

Relying on a client for personal and emotional support.

Giving or receiving significant gifts.

Suggesting or supporting the client‚Äôs isolation from social support systems, increasing dependency on the therapist.

Providing or using alcohol or drugs during sessions.

If you are experiencing any of these warning signs, you have the right to file a complaint with the appropriate licensing board and consult with another therapist.

I had the opportunity to report him when I was 13, but I didn‚Äôt as I hadn‚Äôt really figured out it was rape yet or maybe I did and was in denial as I didn‚Äôt want to be a  ‚Äúraped girl ‚Äú. I just wanted to forget it , and never ever think about it . I am 16 now and feel so guilty about not reporting it . But the details are problematic . I was 6 and he was 12. He‚Äôs not gonna yet convixted for something he did then . But what if another girl reports , my report could have helped her be taken seriously . I went on an unpopular opinion thread and people said that rape victims who don‚Äôt report are enabling the rapist which only added on to my guilt . Also my mother has a tendency to blame sexual assault victims and I knew she‚Äôd ask why I didn‚Äôt tell her before. When I told her she didn‚Äôt handle it well AT ALL. She said I was stupid for not telling her sooner , except we don‚Äôt have a good relashionship. The ducking wall understands me better . Maybe even a shoe would understand me better . I doubt whether I could have handled that at 13. She also asked so many intrusive questions and wouldn‚Äôt stop probing . At 13, that would have tortured me . I feel like it‚Äôs my fault and I have some responsibility in his crimes to future victims. Even other rape victims on that thread shamed women for not reporting. I might report later on when we go back to my native country as i know my rape wasn‚Äôt my fault. Edit; my native country is India where the police don‚Äôt give a fuck. Even when I was 13, it‚Äôs 6 years since the incident , so they probably wouldn‚Äôt have believed me . I know one person who would give evidence but even so , he‚Äôs 12, they‚Äôre not gonna put him behind bars as he was a minor .

rily4s,therapy,1639760836.0,"I can‚Äôt help but feel responsible for what happened to my family member. I feel like it wouldn‚Äôt be right to not be mad at myself. I‚Äôm having a really difficult time today and need to write down my thoughts. But first let me tell the story‚Ä¶

A long time  ago me and a family member (call her Amy) and I went over to a friends house (call him Fred) to go out to the bar and have some fun. I talked to Fred beforehand and asked if we could spend the night because We planned on drinking pretty heavily. We wanted to have fun. I wish we knew ways to have fun back then without drugs or drinking but that‚Äôs besides the point. It was our first time hanging out!! It was exciting! We kinda knew we were planning to over indulge a little‚Ä¶. A lot. Irresponsible I know, Amy and I were 22-23 at the time. Anyways, he said YEAH! No problem.‚Äù So I told Amy that we had somewhere to sleep in case we have too much to drink. Now on to PARTY!

So we go out I‚Äôm buying everyone drinks Fred wasn‚Äôt drinking cuz he drove us there and back but I got Amy and I drinks cuz I had a pretty good job at the time. I was happy to pay. Amy is the coolest person I‚Äôve ever hung out with. But Amy and I drank way too much to where when last call was made. We‚Äôre making jokes saying ‚Äúwho‚Äôs calling!?!?‚Äù Amy and I somehow were able to coordinate our way back to FREDs car. it‚Äôs time to go back to Freds parents place and crash. Everything was fine. Fred didn‚Äôt say anything about there being a problem with us spending the night. We were laying on the couch and both fell asleep. Out of nowhere Fred runs into the living room and says very frantically he just received a call from his parents and they‚Äôre coming home early!!!! he‚Äôll be in trouble if we‚Äôre here when they get home! I don‚Äôt want Fred to get in trouble so I start calling a cab and getting our things together but I couldn‚Äôt get Amy up! I tried and tried and tried but I couldn‚Äôt get her up. I didn‚Äôt think about carrying her. I‚Äôve got stuff in my hands and how would that look to the cab driver I‚Äôm still very drunk. But I should have known I have a higher alcohol tolerance than Amy. The friend is very pushy for me to leave and he starts pushing me out the door saying don‚Äôt worry about it she‚Äôll be alright. I‚Äôll just tell my parents some story about how I met her and she couldn‚Äôt get up they‚Äôll understand. So I left thinking Amy was safe. 

When Amy got back to my place the next morning we talKed about how fucked up it was that he kicked me out like that. I asked if his parents were there when she got up and she looked at me confused and said, ‚ÄúNo?‚ÄùI told her what happened and she just said ‚Äúhuh that‚Äôs weird‚Ä¶.‚Äù I asked frantically, ‚ÄúDid he do anything to you?‚Äù She looked right at me and was like ‚ÄúNO WAY!‚Äù Laughing. I laughed too she had me fooled. She did it so well. Even after pressing her she would always laugh it off and told me I need to stop asking. So I did. I mean I was with her the whole night I‚Äôm positive he wasn‚Äôt able to skip something in her drink and I couldn‚Äôt possibly accuse someone of rape without Amy saying she was‚Ä¶.

8 years later we were at home and somehow that topic came up. So I pressed her one last final time. She begins to cry hysterically and tells me she was raped. She barley wakes up in a stupor with with him raping her. In a drunken stupor and unable to fight back. 
I feel like this is all my fault. Even worse is the guy is successful now. When I called him out on it over text he said he doesn‚Äôt remember and the only reason we would remember is cuz it only impacted us. Why am I so stupid? Why did god make me so fucking stupid. I should have seen this coming from a mile away. But I cared more about being DRUNK! Getting Amy drunk! It was MY RESPONSIBILITY TO KEEP HER SAFE THAT NIGHT. I thought she was safe. So sailfish and so stupid. 

I don‚Äôt know anyone personally here on Reddit so I‚Äôll just go ahead and say the family member is my wife. I love her more than anything. I don‚Äôt care about her past or anything. All I care about is her and giving her as much love and care as she needs. And more than ANYONE has ever given her. I love her. She doesn‚Äôt hate me. Why do I hate myself for this when she doesn‚Äôt‚Ä¶ I hope I can forgive myself

If there is anything anyone can say to me to help me, help us. We have cried for hours/days in each others arms. She says it‚Äôs not my fault it‚Äôs just the doing of someone extremely evil. I think she hid it from me because she knew I would blame myself. Anyone that has read this and/or reply I thank you with all my heart in advance. 

I hope this message can be a learning tool for a young one out there

Growing up I didn't really have that family dynamic, so it's a lot harder to adjust to that. My parents were the type of people that would say ""figure it out yourself"" if I ever came across a problem, so it's what I got used to. I have gotten past that and have tried to help when people have come to me for it, but I have trouble with helping ""just because"" because I don't know, I don't really see an issue till it's brought up, or I don't really see their struggle unless they ask.

So in the end, to me, I worry about myself really and think that everyone's holding their own well without my interference, and looking back at it, I can see how that can be selfish, but to me I always thought I was trying to be independent and I was sure that if someone needed me they'd ask.

All in all I was used to growing up handling my MI (mental illness) without medication. The meds I used when I had the opportunity once I turned 18, weren‚Äôt good for me, I met my current bf at age 20, and my life was really looking up, for once, I stopped taking medication and tried to just handle it on my own for the last 3 years, which was working to an extent. 

Then COVID hit, I know yeah yeah COVID does suck for us all, I was a germaphobe before this mess, I also work in a school, where the children are not required to wear masks, so they don‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt have a car and this school is the only one close to my house. I have a communications degree but never wanted anything to do with it after graduation. Now that COVIDs hit I wonder what remote options there are available for people like me, when working in general is just very hard.

Of course it‚Äôs now creeping back up into the professional world. I get such bad anxiety with COVID, I originally thought better precautions would be done for the school, but it‚Äôs a small private school so they can pretty much do as they please. And a lot of the families are ‚ÄúCOVID deniers‚Äù to say the least. To add to the mix, I‚Äôm an asthmatic, who‚Äôs smoked MJ more than I‚Äôd like to admit to ‚Äúself medicate‚Äù, out of enjoyment, etc. so, once COVID finds me, who knows what‚Äôll happen.

Maybe it‚Äôs all a blessing in disguise (an attempt at positivity haha). The overthinking and anxiety garbage, can I turn off my brain please? Oh how I wish I could... it‚Äôs why sleep is so addicting for people like me, it‚Äôs the only way to shut it off for a while. 

My bf is very loving and understanding, he‚Äôs my rock, and I am his. I know, I know I‚Äôve heard and seen it all before ‚Äúlove yourself before you can love anyone else‚Äù see for people with MI, I can love and respect myself, but hate my brain. People can throw cliche sayings all they want but the reality is every single relationship is different, bc people are all so very different and complex, shit goes far deeper than the average saying.

u5bztu,therapy,1650158052.0,"I apologize in advance if this is long. I‚Äôm in marriage counseling with my husband of two years. About two weeks before we got engaged, we went wine tasting. Both were a little tipsy. We agreed to have sex without a condom with the agreement that he would pull out. As we were having sex he came inside of me intentionally. It was no accident. I said why would you do that? And he started to cry and say that he loved me so much and just couldn‚Äôt wait to have a baby with me. He knew I wasn‚Äôt on birth control. I honestly felt shocked. I didn‚Äôt know what to say or feel or do. I felt pissed but then guilty for being pissed because was it that he just really loved me? I got the morning after pill the next day. He proposed two weeks later. After he proposed, we talked about what kind of wedding to have. Now this is during Covid, so a lot of different factors play into it. He wanted a big wedding, and I didn‚Äôt. But I said if you want that then we should do it and we started planning the wedding he wanted. Now not much had happened, I had researched and called a few venues and we started a guest list. 

A few weeks later I found out I was pregnant. He knew this was the last thing that I wanted was to have a baby out of marriage in this way. I was torn because I wanted a baby of course but not in this way. So we decided to elope with our immediate families in the next few weeks and keep the baby. We booked a non refundable elopement for like 9k. A few weeks later, I miscarried. I felt so much conflicted emotions - sad because I miscarried and at the same time relieved because I never wanted this but the decision was taken away from me. It was a mind fuck. 

Now our families don‚Äôt know how I ended up pregnant or what happened. My husband had told me he wanted to go through with the elopement anyway, we had spent a lot of money on it. I did too. So we elope. And I thought we had a beautiful day. Fast forward a while and I find out that he told his mom that he couldn‚Äôt have the wedding he wanted because I wouldn‚Äôt allow it. This felt like a huge betrayal on top of an already messed up situation.

I guess my question is, am I unreasonable for feeling violated and betrayed from his lack of impulse control one night where he ignored that he was supposed to pull out that led to an unwanted pregnancy? And then the later total twist of what happened to place blame onto me for our elopement, when he was telling me he was happy with it, and make me look like this unreasonable wife that doesn‚Äôt care about his wishes? 

This is a sensitive subject for me so please be kind even if you think I‚Äôm way off base. I ask because our marriage counselor made a comment when I brought this up saying ‚Äúwell it‚Äôs a betrayal of your trust, get to the point.‚Äù And after ‚Äúboy it sure sounds like this was a guy that really loved you and was excited to start a family with you.‚Äù 

That felt very dismissive for one, but objectively off base for two. I don‚Äôt think this is just a minor little betrayal of my trust. It doesn‚Äôt feel like love, it felt like total disrespect.

So today was my second session with my therapist and I told him about my ex-boyfriend and our history. We broke things off four years ago (well, he did) due to being long distance because of work and have been in and out of communication ever since, but I constantly thought about him. I talked about how happy I was that he told me he missed me and wanted to try our relationship again, since we didn't leave off on bad terms, as well as my anxiety surrounding dating and abandonment issues. I did a lot of the talking with my therapist nodding and jotting down notes.

I was both confused and angry that he would even bring that up and asked ""why don't you believe me?"" 

His response ""You just don't seem like the type of person who would date"". I ended up pulling out my phone to show him our messages with each other, old photos to which he muttered, ""okay, that's enough, I see""

My heart was pounding, and my anxiety was at an absolute all-time high in this moment. I genuinely felt like I was going to die. or throw up. Or both. I was getting flashbacks of when I used to accidentally do something wrong growing up (ie:break something, drop a plate, knock over a glass etc), and I was really genuinely terrified in this moment, although I may not have seemed this way. As my shop teacher (middle aged male) was showing me the PROPER way that I should have torqued the spark plugs, I thought I was going to pass out. I was really humiliated and embarrassed with myself, and I felt as though I was going to pass out. I was sweating and shaking uncontrollably and I truly don't know how I saved myself from throwing up. I honestly could have. Anyways yeah so this is my little vent here. I have no idea if i will ever feel safe around men, and especially confrontation of any sort revolving around men. My father used to beat me and tell me he was going to kill me and murder me when I used to do things wrong. This is something that I live with everyday that no one knows about.

I am a great example of this. ....even thinking about this scenario right this moment is making my anxiety high all over again and i am sweating and shaking all over again.

ma9u5r,therapy,1616371509.0,"I find myself wanting to interact with my family less and less. 70% of our interactions are negative and leave me feeling much worse off than before the interaction. I just had a phone call with my mom where she hung up crying.

Background:I'm 38 years old. Male

2 parents, still married, in their 70s, retired with not much going on

1 brother

Growing up: normal suburbia mid-size town life. Played sports, parents went to games, supported me, gave me their best advice, nothing really bad. Dad came off as a know it all and posed his advice as fact which I listened to because he was successful and I didn't know any better and his advice turned out to be very limiting and dead wrong in many instances that really hurt me.

&#x200B;

Now:I live 3 hours away. Parents want to talk to me all the time but I do not enjoy our phone calls nor being around them. We used to see each other 1x ever 2-3 months until probably 80% of those interactions turned out to be very negative with one of us leaving early or a really big nasty blowout argument with yelling. I am increasing how harsh/mad I get the older I get... I thought it'd be the opposite. I think I have so many other great things going on in my life that I value my time more than ever so when something negatively impacts my life I immediately want to push it out.

&#x200B;

My dad:interrupts, tells me what to do (is wrong almost all the time), doesn't say anything about his life or anything... just wants to talk about me/interview me, comes off as very arrogant (states things as fact rather than his opinion) then defends himself vigorously when he's questioned, is extremely long-winded, very bad communicator. Not articulate at all and it's a struggle to understand what he's even trying to say half the time. Basically, the conversations become completely uninteresting and require a lot of patience and I don't think either of us get any value out of them so what's the point?

My mom:very loving and nice. No problems with her except she is not that articulate either and is long-winded and doesn't share much about her life and prefers to interview me. She also is a very scared/worried type of person and projects that on me. If I take a trip she will research all the dangers and let me know of ALL of them and nothing positive at all. Just a scared mentality and I have the complete opposite mentality and it's very irritating to constantly be badgered with that. Unfortunately, things are so rough with my dad that she will say things that remind me of him and trigger reactions that are too extreme for what they should be. She's basically getting dumped on by me and I don't give her enough patience.

&#x200B;

Overall:I'm just not enjoying talking to them like I used to. They aren't doing anyting in particular that's ""bad"" but I just don't have an interest in it and the ""bad"" things they do are really impacting me negatively. The way they are is wearing me thin and I'm not happier or feeling better off after we talk... even if there is no fight on the phone I'm just like ""welp there went 30 mins for nothing"". It makes me feel terrible. I have this huge amount of guilt like I owe them for raising me, caring for me, giving me life etc. I also get very sad when I think of them getting older and how much or little time we may have left. I read something recently where a guy said how old do you think your parents will live till? How about 90. You see them 4x per year. So if they're 70, that's 20 more years, 4x per year, so only 80 more times you see them. That perspective really hit me but the problem is I'm still just not enjoying talking with them. I'm considering not going home for the holidays. My parents aren't that close with anyone else nor have any other family (their parents RIP).

&#x200B;

When we fight:My patience is very low. I give them 1-2 chances then I get very stern/harsh with them. When I get harsh they get very defensive and never take responsibility. Instead, the conversation now becomes me being too harsh. I take what they do very seriously... like someone calling me ""idiot"" does not impact me but them doing what they do does the same damage as if I'd call them ""idiot"" but they don't understand that. The other aspects of my life I really love so when we fight, I immediately am like why are we even talking I'm going to go and just end the phone call and don't talk for another 1-2 weeks... but that's turning into 2-3 weeks... and will progress into even longer. I didn't talk to my dad for 3 months last year and I'd say overall I felt better.

Right now I feel like my only option is to grin and bear it or just speak to them only when I'm in a great mood with a lots of patience and keep the calls short... I'd love to have that movie style family where we play games, have dinners, talk all the time etc. I've tried VERY hard for 5 years to do that. Read books, talked with other people for HOURS, talked to them at EXTREME lengths about how I was feeling, why I felt that way, what I suggest we try etc but the results are nearly non-existant.

&#x200B;

I guess I'm at a wits end. I don't know what to do. I've read books, forum posts, friends, etc and tried a million different things and nothing has helped. I don't think our relationship will ever be what I want it to be and that's disappointing and sad because to me it seems very easy to achieve.  They flat out refuse any kind of therapy and view me as the problem. They think I'm just an angry guy and they aren't doing anything wrong/bad. I believe that their belief of theirs is causing them to not make any real change so this situation will likely just stay the same. I also know I am 100% responsible for my actions and how I feel. I just feel bad that I don't want to talk to them anymore really. I am worried I will regret it but the constant fights are really taking a toll on me. This has held me back from other aspects of my life so incredibly much and is impacting how I treat other people.

hq1qgf,therapy,1594586838.0," I know that I am likely in the small minority of victims who feel this way but I also don't look at myself as a ""victim"". Yes I was taken advantage of and abused with power and control and pressure to do favors but I just don't see myself that way, and I feel for those who have suffered worse or under worse terms.

( Link for My story if you want to get some background to my situation. contact me)

Yes I have come to terms with it being labelled s abuse but again I also dont see myself as a victim because I feel I could have stopped it sooner, and I was not r a p e or physically abused to do the things, I know thats not the only thing that makes someone a victim I just personally choose to look beyond that.

But yes I see this person G lets call him maybe once a year or so and nothing has ever been said or anything about those past moments, but Im sure he remembers it just as I did and maybe feels bad about it or maybe has just sort of grown up and moved past it in his own way. I try not to think about it more just to heal and share my story with others on reddit or anonymously. Maybe that is another reason is I have never told ANYONE in my life and im sure it is the same for him. I chose to live with it, reflect on it and grow, yes it took years and yes it took looking down on myself, shame, regret, embarrassment etc. However I also used to blame it for having attractions to men and exploring with men and having bi attractions and desires. That also I have come to terms with just being me and being natural.That i would be that way regardless but as I said I used to look at that as the worse thing to come from this.

I also wonder whether it was me also feeling very ashamed that it was another guy I was exploring with and how that was culturally and just around my peers looked at as wrong, and gay as wrong, bi as wrong, and being very judged and hated on. So that was another reason to keep that very hidden but also the abuse hidden because they were tied together for me. I used to tie them together as me being double wrong and doing double the shame and regretful things. Peers and pressure and cultures and religion and just judgement from others shaped many peoples lives and preferences and feelings and just hiding being themselves but I definitely think for myself it was even more looked down on and made me extra careful and hidden.

As the years went by I got to learn and explore and be myself and do what I want to do but also with regret and shame in the early teen and 20s. Now 10-20 years later I look back on it that I should have enjoyed those moments I was in and not have been so ashamed and fearful and embarrassed, I think I would have been more free and expressive and enjoyed the experiences more but I also don't regret doing what I have done and explored with who I have... It has made me learn more about me and my likes and desires and be able to just be me and enjoy life. Its still a hidden side from the public and people I know.. but for me its about accepting myself that is more important than others accepting me for who I am.

So the hate and anger went to just being normal and accepting all that happened and who I am. Sure I feel a little regret about not living my life truly for who I am... but I think accepting myself for who I am is more important than s escapades and fun. I do try to enjoy my life now for every moment and every opportunity and that is what I want others to do as well who have suffered s abuse or any abuse or trauma as a child. I want them to grow and be happy and loving people, be able to enjoy hugs, touches, kisses, intercourse and not be forever traumatized.

I am here as a last resort. I don't have access to therapy at the moment and this seems to be my only option as of now.

First a little about me. You guys can call me JJ and I am a 16 year old.

I think I am a pedophile. I have never abused a kid but I am having thoughts about it. (I have not been abused either) It started when I was 13 and continues till today. After COVID started, it seems to have gotten stronger. The thoughts are usually a voice, but can sometimes be an image which provokes what I call a ""groinal response"" (erection). I don't like the thoughts and would never hurt a kid but I am not sure at this point. 

Some days are worse than others and these last few months have been the worst. I've had crushes on people my age in the past, but not anymore. Now, I can't seem to get  a groinal response from anything else but the thoughts which worries me. I have dealt with depression symptoms (not therapist diagnosed, just symptoms of google) in the past and I am a bit better now although I do deal with a lot of guilt. 

I am holding off going to a therapist because I fear about what they will diagnose me with. I really don't want to be labelled a pedophile.

hnth2u,therapy,1594256148.0,"A few years ago this girl had sex with me while I was black out drunk. She was drunk too but it wasn't really a big deal to her. She was going through a period of being depression where she got drunk and had sex with random people. It really messed me up for awhile.

After it happened I tried reaching out to her about it. She was an acquaintance and we shared a friend. After this I reached out to her to ask if she wanted to be friends. I wanted her to make me feel better but I wasn't sure how. She said ""nah im good. I dont need anymore friends."". This felt beyond shitty. I felt used.

Whatever. Those first few days I was crazy anxious. I had random moments where I remembered patches of that night. Eventually I move out of town and my anxiety subsided for awhile. I was super busy but my mind would go to that place whenever I had any downtime. It seemed like any time I felt down my mind would fall into a pit of that night. I can't explain the level of my anxiety. It was all consuming. I kept constantly remembering those little patches of memories and how she treated me. 

I started drinking an increasing amount. I actually sent her a few drunk texts about it, on multiple nights. I don't remember her first few responses but they always felt shitty. Eventually she said ""I'm sorry I dont remember."" That was that. 

I got a specific tattoo on a sensitive part of my body to remind me to stay calm and not be anxious. I really focused on the pain of the tattoo and I looked at it every time I felt anxiety. My anxiety stopped. 

Her being a friend of a friend. I'd see her when I came into town. I fixated on her when I came back home. I actually paid more attention to her than the friend I actually came to hang out with. I was like I mentally highlighted everything she did to me that was nice. Wow, she handed me a drink. She showed some basic human consideration for me. I was constantly finding these things as though it'd make me feel better in a way that I didnt understand. It was like I was looking for an answer that I didnt know the question too.

Fast forward, our shared friend died. In the pain or this, I was around that girl a lot. I felt like this thing with her came back up. Both issues, my friends death and being around her were equally large weights on my neck. I saw how she had all of these friends come to her and comfort her, while I'm mostly a loner. I felt like this made her a good person. I'm weird for being hurt. I shouldn't have felt the way I did but I couldn't stop it. 

My (dead) friend's family wants us to all keep and touch and have nights together but I've decided not to. I am certain that I will see this girl and continue to be in touch with her if I do keep in touch with everyone else. I shouldn't put their needs above my own. I shouldn't have to be around her. It doesn't feel good.

I feel like my future I always wanted for myself isn't possible and it's out of my control. She kept telling me I didn't need a partner if I wanted kids. That I could do it on my own. 

That idea sounded absurd to me and I told her so. She said I was making a choice. I don't feel like it's a choice. I don't want kids if I have to do it myself because I don't have any support for being a single mom. Ideally I'd either work 1-2 days a week or not work until my youngest started school. 

Dating as a single mom would be even more difficult for me. But she kept saying it was my choice. I feel like the fact that men don't like me is out of my control and therefore kids would be out of my control. She again said not having kids would be my choice.

It seems like there are a handful of sites containing lists of psychologists, psychiatrists, therapists, social workers, etc and these professionals are all shots in the dark.  You call them, most of the time they don't have any openings despite being listed as having openings.  

When I do call, I feel like I have really no clue if I'm choosing an appropriate professional.

Seems like if you don't already have a referral from someone trusted,  then you really know extremely little about the choice you're making, there's not much informational available.

It would be so advantageous, considering the mental distress and hopelessness that some feel when they are searching for a professional, if there were just a service where someone could work with you to help you with a referral or to connect you with a curated list of professionals with availability who are suggested to be appropriate for you.

My first therapist was awful - changed the time of our session 15 mins before meeting, the 'hour long session' was closer to 30 minutes, and I could hear her kids shouting in the background.

I complained, and Betterhelp promised to give me a free week (extra session) with a new therapist. I agreed, although canceled my monthly subscription, as I was now feeling wary.

I found another therapist (who was pretty good to be fair) and had two sessions with her. However my third session was on the last day of the month, by which time my cancellation came into effect. So I hadn't been given a free week as promised.

I couldn't contact her, although I could still receive messages from her asking if I was okay, what happened etc? I couldn't respond to these, which was frankly infuriating.

I messaged Betterhelp a number of times - every time they gave me the stock response that they could only help me if I renewed my subscription.

I'm so angry that a company that claims to help people would treat its users like this. Please don't make the same mistake as me, and avoid them!

But recently she's been going through quite a bit of shit in her life. Depression, anxiety, a concision, anorexia, family problems the list goes on. She's been going to A LOT of doctor appointments, been on many different meds, trying to find something to help her. I'm always trying to support her, we talk about things to eachother and I know things have been hard. 

But most recently her eating disorder has been really bad, like really really bad. I hear my other friends saying she looks so good and hot and all I see is the fact that she hasn't eaten in days.
The other week she went to get an ECG, I'm not exactly what for but her results came back not looking to great. She has a pretty low heart rate from her reduction of calories over a long period of time. Her doctor told her that there's a risk or heart attack. 
Her doctor gave her different options to try and help her and she has declined them all. Refusing help until she hits ""rock bottom"" which for her is when she's in the hospital.

Hearing this has pretty much destroyed me. I try my best to be there for her and support her in all the way I possibly can, but I literally can even look at her without wanting to cry. I continuously picture going to her funeral or sitting beside her watching a movie and she has a heart attack. The thought of her dying will break me in so many ways I wouldn't know what to do with myself. 
She's very stubborn and won't listen to anything anyone else has to say, I don't know how to help her and I don't even know if I can. 

I know telling this to some random people on Reddit won't fix anything but I need to get this off my chest and the only people in my life that I've told barley even responded to what I was telling them.

I am a highly functioning well adjusted person, however, I can get obsessive over things. I don't obsessive over people or anything, but I will get obsessed over things I want to buy or events happening in the future.

After a few weeks the impulse passed, but it was a rough few weeks where I could only think about that and agonize over whether I should get one or not. It drove my fiancee nuts hearing me go on about it constantly.

I flipped a switch in my brain to get on board with this, but now I'm obsessed with it. I can't stop thinking about it. I want all of the planning to get done.

t98vhu,therapy,1646714880.0,"My therapist is a white American, and I am Asian-American. We're both disabled, and I was asking her about the anti-inflammatory diet. I said it might be difficult to follow the diet when I visit my family in the Philippines and I said, ""the meat options might be difficult..."" (it was just in the moment; I know now how to make it work) and she cut in and said, ""oh because they eat dog?"" and I was like what ?? because my family is from Manila and I honestly have never seen anyone eat dog. I don't have an issue with eating dog, but I feel like it was just unreasonable to bring up since it wouldn't be hard to avoid eating it at all. Dog meat is not legal for sale in the Philippines.

This post might not make sense to people, but her comment has been bothering me so much because eating dog has only been used as an insult towards me in the past, and so many East/Southeast Asian Americans have experienced these insults. Non-Asians tend to exaggerate how much Asians eat dog to justify their myth that Western food and people are superior and civilized compared to Asians.

My dilemma is that I don't feel comfortable continuing therapy with her without addressing this. But I also feel like even if I explain to her why what she said bothered me, I will still feel uncomfortable. I guess I feel like if she was ignorant enough to make that comment, then that means that she looks at me through the lens of a white person viewing a foreign non-white instead of therapist viewing client.

I've also asked her before how to deal with microaggressions from people, and I'm just not satisfied with her advice.

I had also been indoctrinated for years under the idea that ‚Äútherapy is for weak people who can‚Äôt figure out their shit on their own‚Äù. 

So it took a lot for me to finally find a new therapist and go forward with therapy, but I did. And I couldn‚Äôt be happier about it. The therapist I found is absolutely amazing and I connect with her in a deep way. She makes me feel comfortable right from the start. It‚Äôs been nothing but positive experiences and the conversation flows easily. It‚Äôs been worth every penny, and I‚Äôve left the sessions often feeling like I had just ran a marathon, but in a good way - exhausted but accomplished.

Now I feel like my enthusiasm for therapy may be getting in the way of actual healing.

I guess though that these past few weeks and this new interest of mine in really pursuing therapy and making it useful has pushed me down a road of ‚Äúokay there‚Äôs all this stuff that I need to work through and I want to get through it fast‚Äù. Being more alone these past few weeks has also helped give me space to sit with all these feelings and thoughts I now feel the need to share.

I've been feeling like this for quite a while and had actually accepted that I'm going to live my life in this numb state for the rest of my life. But, my recent interaction with a friend made me feel better for a very short span. 
He had goals, he'd been working his ass off to reach them. And no, they're not exactly regarding his passion. It's just he wants to reach a particular position in the job (manager/senior manager) within the set age. And, is able to work on a job that he's not exactly is passionate about.
And this made me question myself for a while, even I had an aim to get to manager role by a given age. But, when I started working, I never found any job that I had taken so far to want to make me work more, or even to work to maintain the job. I work for a while, and when I feel like things keep getting too difficult or boring, I quit and find something else, but now as years went, I partly regret for not being able to stick to a commitment even in an easy job. But, I still want to reach to a good position. 
So, when interacted with this friend, it made me want to commit myself to the job that I do now and to aim for a shorter goal and move step by step. And things were going smoothly for a while. But, had a recent clash with my senior staff who is now cornering me and gave me a difficult task, and now I again feel like quitting if possible. But, I aslo so desperately don't want to quit as the company has a good name for itself and I wanna learn and make something out of myself here. 
I am a 25(F) living with my parents, and it just struck me of the responsibilities I would face if I wanted to take responsibility on myself. And it is scaring the shit out of me. 
But, this is not the only reason I feel like I wanna 'cease to exist' as, I've been feeling that a job or anything is only being forced up on me, to meet self created expectations and self created evaluation and analysing. But, naturally there are not needed to live. Thus, making me feel like I shouldn't work or something.

This statistic freaks me out - apparently chronic loneliness and isolation has a similar effect on mortality as smoking absurd amounts of cigarettes.  But what does this mean exactly?  Obviously loneliness cannot cause death in the same way as smoking, so what is it specifically about loneliness that shortens a person's lifespan?  Does loneliness have an actual biochemical effect on the brain and organs that cause them to fail sooner, or is this statistic skewed by higher probability of suicide or unhealthy coping habits as a result of loneliness?

And is it actually loneliness that causes the damage to a person's health?  Or is it the \*feeling\* or \*perception\* of being lonely that causes harm?

Ok so

Two years ago my ex who was struggling with gender dysphoria was seeing this great therapist so I made an appointment. I have very bad anxiety especially in social situations so it's hard for me to talk to people but I pushed myself to do it. 

We got a little too close
She would talk to me about her problems and mine
She would tell me about my BF and if he was threatening me or what was going on (long story short we were in a lawsuit over my previous home )
She introduced me to her family
Had me.over for dinner
Cooked me lasagna for my birthday 
Told me. I love you like a daughter. 

Two. Years. 
Now. She is nowhere to be found. I messaged her son. Just to see if she is OK. He left me on read. I think that tells me what I need to know. 

 Its fine if she does not want to see me but I would have been looking for a new one. Idk why its so hard to just reply and say no sessions available. 

People are telling me she can't do this but what about if she is hurt or sick or anything. Then I will feel like a complete Donkey. 

She has even called me bawling and I have talked her through things. 

The problem with our relationship was that I think it was definitely a lot to do with the fact that my mom abused me for years and I've never had a loving mother figure. So she stepped into that role, and it made me happy but I didn't really care if it was unethical. 

I don't know where to go from here. So much trauma. So much information that she and only she herself knew. Never judged me. I have a very hard time trusting people . So im terrified to even GO to another therapist. Can't focus on work 100% because I'm always worried. Need therapist. Where is my old therapist is she dead. Is she fired.

hjvujx,therapy,1593691806.0,"Just as a heads-up, if you're looking for an inspirational/feel-good story...this post probably ain't it. I just feel kind of ashamed, and like I have to get this off my chest.

I started therapy a few months ago to try and deal with some serious self-esteem, anxiety, and depression issues. Almost all of those stemmed from relationship/intimacy issues; namely, my lack thereof. I've never had a girlfriend, never even kissed anyone at the age of 26. And it's definitely not for lack of trying. I got on the whole self-improvement kick in an attempt to get myself in a better place where I might have some success trying to date. But that didn't seem to have any affect, and so I decided that therapy was the last option I had left. Especially considering how much the depression centering around this issue was starting to really burn other areas of my life. So I started online sessions and the results were...mixed, to say the least.

I didn't last long with my first therapist. That wasn't really any fault of her own, to be completely fair. I think that whatever algorithm this site used to match you to therapists/counselors went haywire, because I got connected with a therapist who specialized in things like eating disorders and OCD. We both kinda realized that early on and she recommended trying someone else.

The second one started off fairly promising. She talked about incorporating techniques from CBT, exposure therapy, etc. At first I thought we were off to a good start until about two weeks in. She started to talk about things like chi, and how a ""common energy"" connected every living being on earth, how I had to find ""the being who balances your energy"". I pretty quickly realized that this wasn't what I was looking for, and wasn't doing me any good.

The third therapist was just 100% convinced that I had some severe childhood trauma that I wasn't revealing to him, and that it was the root cause of all my current problems. I tried explaining that no, my childhood was actually pretty great all things considered, and that these problems really only started to show up in the past six years or so. But this guy was just dead-set on the idea that I'd suffered some sort of horrendous trauma early in life. I stopped seeing him after a few weeks.

I had some hope with my final therapist. She seemed very level-headed and took a slightly more ""practical"" approach to my problems. After a few sessions just to establish some goals and what I wanted out of therapy she recommended some things that I could try, especially when it came to building confidence and self-esteem. Namely exercising, making healthy diet changes, finding new hobbies, etc. But we hit a bit of a wall, because well...I'd already done all of those things before starting therapy. And it felt like nothing had changed. I was still just as shy, introverted, and terrified of people (especially women) as I was before. We kept trying for another month or so, but last week I just realized nothing was working. I sent her a message thanking her for her time and trying to help, and at least she seemed understanding about why I wanted to ""take a break"" from therapy, although she tried to convince me to stay. But I just wasn't getting anything out of it.

I'm sorry this post is so long but to be perfectly honest I feel like I'm at the end of my rope. Therapy was basically my ""last ditch"" effort, y'know? I've tried everything I can think of but never saw any real tangible results. I'm just as single as always and hating myself because of it. I know that people say ""you have to love yourself before you can love someone else"", but frankly it's pretty hard to love myself first when nobody's ever shown me that I'm worthy of that. And now I'm back at square one.

At first, I thought it was a really pessimist thought, but as I thought about it, over and over in my head, ai realised that sometimes, hope can indeed be torture for us. 

I am not saying that hope doesn't matter, cause it does, it's one of the things that brings the world forward, but there are times I life, when we are so blinded by the hope of getting something, that we don't realise that it's not worth it anymore, if you ve given your best, and still nothing happened, perhaps it's time to think about moving on, I mean, what's the point of pursuing something, if even when you do get what you want, your strength will just be drained? 

We need to learn how to move on from things, when they re not worth it anymore. 

Stop hoping things will be better or change and start doing what you can, move on to other opportunities, new people, you will find freedom in the realization that you re not trapped by your hope anymore, and it will make you happier 

Letting go of excessive hope isn't believing that things will be bad, or wishing that, or even not believing that there will good things, it's knowing that, everything can go exactly as you want, but everything can also go extremely wrong 
Basically, don't get your hopes high too soon, take some time to evaluate situations, so you can always be ready to move on and face misfortunes.

ug9dz1,therapy,1651439099.0,"I lost my 15 month old puppy due to my, my family‚Äôs and the doctor‚Äôs carelessness.

It was all fine, he was a healthy and happy dog. He had a good diet, he was well exercised, he had all necessary vaccinations done and he was really happy. 

It probably started when he tried climbing my bed (he‚Äôs a big dog and he was 14 months old), he seemed to be struggling to climb it. But I kept cheering on him saying, ‚Äúyou can do it bud.‚Äù

Then I heard a crack, I thought something happened to his leg. I tried checking but he looked fine and lied down on my bed. 

He‚Äôs walking and playing fine too the next few consecutive days. But just after a few days, he starts limping along his right hind leg. We take him to a vet immediately and we got his X-ray done. 

The vet says he has a luxating patella and he says to wait it out a few days to see if he could manage without surgery. If not he would have to go through surgery.

The vet prescribed us a painkiller for our dog for his waiting period. The next three to two days were awful, my baby lost his spark. He would walk while limping, he could no longer run and play like he used to.

I hugged him and gave him so many kisses and all I hoped was he would be back to normal.

Fast forward to two days, the night before his passing, he could barely walk a few steps. He barely ate.He looked so drugged and in pain, he tried getting up to pee but he fell. He looked so sad that he wasn‚Äôt able to do such a simple task. 

It was now the morning of his passing, he looked so much in pain and so we decided to take him to emergency care. We took him to a different hospital, since the initial hospital we took him to only starts operating around 11AM. My dad took him to the city‚Äôs best clinic.

There he was given an IV drip and few other injections. He was made to walk a little to check his mobility and he walked fine. An X-ray was taken of him and these doctors suggested he had a hairline fracture on his back, which has no cure other than limiting mobility and being on bed rest and waiting for it to heal back on its own by time.

They sent him back home, on the way back home in the car he stood up and put his head out to feel the wind, like he always used to (now that I think of it now, it must have been his puppy spirit coming back to life to enjoy one of his most favourite things for one last time).

He arrives home and he‚Äôs incoherent, he‚Äôs not limping anymore but he barely able to stand on his feet, he‚Äôs agitated, he‚Äôs barely able to keep his eyes open. He wailing in pain.

My parents suggest it‚Äôs probably the fracture pain and my grandma used to be like this too when she had her back fractured. Besides, we had just come back from the hospital, there wasn‚Äôt a need to immediately go back and the doctors didn‚Äôt suggest admitting him either.

There he was wailing in our arms and we just stood there and did nothing. It was like an hour or so. After a while he stopped wailing, we thought he‚Äôs finally going to sleep.

My dad slept next to him, my brother sat next to him. Me and my mom went to our rooms.

When suddenly my dad screams, ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not breathing!!!‚Äù

We tried performing cpr(incorrectly), but nothing was happening. His tongue was blue, eyes lifeless and body stiff. He was rushed to the hospital and pronounced dead on arrival.

The hospital offered an autopsy but we chose not to do it as we didn‚Äôt want his body to go under any other unnecessary trauma by which the hospital can just sweep off their mistakes under the rug.

We really lost him, if only we all weren‚Äôt so careless he might have been with us today. Heck, I wish I could turn back time and correct all the mistakes that I had made.

He‚Äôs missing out on all pleasures of life just because we were too nonchalant. I just wish, this was not just where his life ended. I really wish there‚Äôs an afterlife or reincarnation, because it wouldn‚Äôt be fair to him if this is all he ever had.

I miss him so much and every moment as the time goes by his memories keep fading and I don‚Äôt remember him like I used to, it‚Äôs painful.

i3ozh7,therapy,1596566333.0,"That title sounds so douchey to me and this whole post is probably gonna be the same, so I'm sorry about that, but I just realized this this week: I always need to be the best at everything, even if it's something I don't care about. And obviously there's gonna be things that I just can't be the best at, and when that happens I, without realizing that's what I'm doing, convince myself that they're only better than me at it because they worked harder, but that if I worked as hard as them I would have definitely been just as good and better. Which is obviously not true for a lot of things. 

At school I was always top in class and never did much work really. That made me proud to be honest, and now I think it's just messed up a bunch of my thoughts/beliefs. The classes were never so competitive, and in the school I went to there weren't any 'honors' classes or anything. So I think all that stuff just went to my head, and now I think way too highly of myself, yet at the same time still don't at all. Weirdly full of myself and insecure at the same time. I could talk more about that now but one thing at a time. Anyways now I can never seem to wrap my head around the fact that someone can be just simply more talented/ naturally better at something than me. Someone smarter than me I can easily see cause I don't think I'm so smart really, so that hasn't been a problem. Just the 'naturally better at XY' is what I can't ever get.

I could write more but today has been rough and this is a bit exhausting. Maybe another day. 

For context: I'm 17 turning 18. Made this realization because I was upset I was rejected from the number 1 university in the field i want to go to, even though I was already decided on refusing the offer if it came. I'm placing too high standards on myself and I feel like if I don't meet them then... all the suffering was in vain, at least for the university stuff. Other stuff a bit more complicated.

I honestly just want to go to get a degree in animation and get out. Is there something for people like that? I heard of something called an accelerated bachelors degree or something and perhaps something online specifically. I basically wanna do something that takes as little time as possible and is relatively not so expensive that it‚Äôll put me and my family in debt forever ten fold. I‚Äôd be down to go to school purely for animation and nothing else if it meant in 1 to 2 years i‚Äôd get a degree, because I don‚Äôt think i could handle 4 to 6 to 8 years of that.

Also the actual rant incoming:

Essentially COVID fucked me and many 2020 kids over. I never really got to properly have that last day of school or real graduation, just a degree in the mail, never got to say goodbye to any of my friends either. The day ended like any average day in march and that was that, if i knew that was essentially the last day of my youth as kinda kid /late teen I would‚Äôve done so much more man.

I was the type to skip lunch with friends to just study and work for tests that i never ended up taking. It‚Äôs so fucked up how took it all for granted and put so much time into school instead of cherishing those fleeting moments. I know these are feelings one goes through regardless of covid or not but for us 2020 kids especially, a lot of us never really got that closure of properly saying goodbye and transitioning into adulthood. Mentally i feel like i‚Äôm still that 18 year old kid back in march. I don‚Äôt feel like an adult at all, and everyone dumping all these adult responsibilities and pressures on me are freaking me the hell out. Seeing my closest friends growing distant and getting into colleges and moving out is just killing me man...

A part of me wishes things were better, another wants things to change and wish they were different, another part of me just wants everything to stay the same forever and its conflicting af.

I miss everyone, even though i‚Äôve been so productive as of late....that summer of 2019 was probably the last time i was truly happy and I don‚Äôt think I appreciate that feeling enough. There are fleeting moments of motivation and joy here and there and i know I gotta keep moving forward, when this stuff is reminded to me again, i feel all kinds of hurt again.

I‚Äôm not the type to get suicidal and I definitely won‚Äôt cry or kill myself over this, but this pit I‚Äôm feeling really just makes me want to go somewhere far away and just retreat to a bubble all my own and spend my time they‚Äôre drawing and enjoying the luxuries of life until the isolation suffocates and crushes me in it til i just fade away and die.

Anyone know what to do about this, or at least any idea of how i‚Äôm feeling?

TL;DR
Don‚Äôt wanna go to college the traditional way but still wanna get a degree relatively fast and for cheap. I‚Äôm also overwhelmed and stressed af at how fast time is moving and how i feel both old and jaded and young af and don‚Äôt know how to cope with my steadily changing life.

Its hard to talk about these things with older adults a lot cause most don‚Äôt know the feeling of just never getting that closure that came with graduating and that last day of school, so they just tell me dismissively and laugh it off that i‚Äôll get over it and it doesn‚Äôt matter.

Of course i‚Äôll get over it someday, but how? And this moment leaves me feeling so sour, i know in the grand scale its a trivial problem but to me it means everything.

qyp0hs,therapy,1637476377.0,"I've been seeing posts all over various therapy subreddits trashing on CBT. For starters, I am a CBT/ACT based therapist who works primarily with severe anxiety disorders (e.g. health anxiety, panic disorder, social anxiety, phobias, etc) and OCD. I want to first absolutely validate the concerns of everybody who has had ""bad"" CBT. There's nothing worse than leaving therapy feeling invalidated or putting in effort which seems to make you feel even shittier. If a therapist ever told me ""oh, that's a thinking error"" i'd want to run out of the room screaming lol. 

That being said, every time I read those posts I hurt a bit on the inside because I'm reading about bad THERAPY/Therapists and not CBT per say. Good behavioral oriented therapy (I'm talking ACT, CBT, mindfulness, cognitive therapy, etc) is absolutely not a band aid, is not only effective for mild cases, and does not have to be done in an invalidated, rigid, thought-record filled way. Please remember, that CBT was developed by Aaron T. Beck (RIP) as a backlash from psychoanalysis. Beck was like ""hey, we're treating people with analysis for 10 years and they are not getting better...maybe we can directly work with content of their mind and body in a more active way that just having them free associate 3 times per week?""

I won't go into WHY there are so many crap CBT therapists out there, but I will make my case for how life changing good, high quality CBT/ACT can be. I'm going to lump CBT and ACT together on this, but refer to CBT specifically because to does seem to have a worse rap in general than ACT.

1. MYTH:CBT is just a band-aid. CBT is literally the act of fundamentally changing one's relationship with their core ideas about the world, how they respond to pain/suffering, and gaining deep insight into how the things we do (behaviors) affect our experience of the world around us. A good CBT therapist will absolutely not rely on (or even use) thought records. I truly believe that these were really just developed to systematize CBT for research. Rather, they will be an active collaborator with you and help bring a sense of curiosity and openness to your lived experiences. A good CBT Therapist has NO agenda and nothing to prove. They are purely and simply there to walk with their clients and help them identify and move forward from their stuck points. That's all. How I view CBT (as more of a radical behavioralist) is by asking the question ""how can we examine the *function of our behavior (*what purpose it serves...yes this can be seen as psychodynamic), explore how this function was developed over time (e.g. am I depressed because I learned to withdraw from an abusive father), and then how to change the function through a myriad of techniques"".
2. A good CBT therapist will have a flexible conceptualization of their clients that is informed by science (e.g. using principles that have been shown to be relevant to mental health struggles like looking at different forms of avoidance, anxiety sensitivity, mentalization skills, etc) and takes into account the clients entire experience, thoughts, feelings, behaviors, culture, family systems, religion, strengths, etc etc. They will then be able to integrate a broad range of interventions to assist their clients in meeting their goals. Classic CBT interventions include exposure techniques, imagery techniques, Socratic questioning, de-catastrophizing, behavioral experiments, behavioral activation. However, a good CBT therapist will have to be integrative to tailor their treatment and conceptualization to each client. They will borrow techniques from other traditions including mindfulness, inner child work, self-compassion, two-chair techniques (from Gestalt), motivational interviewing, etc. Remember, its all about gaining insight into factors leading us to feel stuck and then figuring out what we can do with that do feel better in the long term.
3. There are so many amazingly powerful CBT techniques that really do get at the core of who we are and how we operate. For example, for clients with BDD, i'll often use perceptual mirror retraining, which gets at the underlying mechanism of hyper focus on a specific flaw as a ritualistic/compulsive behavior (usually serving the purpose of trying to control something that they have no control over...you can say ""thank you"" to your amygdala for that). Mirror retraining teaches people to ""zoom out"" their awareness and gently scan their body (or part of body) in a smooth, compassionate way. They practice this enough and eventually their brain learns that they didn't need to hyper focus on the flaw at all, and it stops happening. Like...forever.
4. Finally, a good CBT therapist will help people challenge their OWN thoughts. They will NOT challenge a client by one upmanship or shaming them in any way whatsoever. Don't want to challenge your thoughts? Great! Let's look at that resistance by going back in time to explore early family relationships or using the here-and-now therapeutic relationship. Good CBT is experiential, emotional, and incredibly healing.

TW: descriptions of a car accident and injury

I‚Äôll start by introducing myself, I‚Äôm about to bare a piece of my soul to the Internet anyway, so you may as well know my name. I‚Äôm Sam.

In January 2019 my life had finally, *finally* started to straighten out. I had a job that seemed like it was tailor made for me; I had only been there for about a month and I was already being looked at for a promotion. I was making more money than I ever had, doing some thing that I genuinely believed in and loved. I had moved in with my best friend, finally breaking out of my parents house. I had a new car, new place, new job, everything was coming up Sam. 

I remember one night so clearly, one night where I felt so at peace, so happy with my place in life. A night where I finally felt like an adult, a put together person, a real grown-up! The Netflix series,  _Russian Doll_, had just come out and I spent all night watching it, curled up in my big comfy chair, in my tidy room, bong in my lap, dog asleep on my bed‚Ä¶ Life was good.

February 14, 2019. My Valentine‚Äôs date was with the back end of a semi truck with faulty brake lights. We met up at 65 miles an hour.

I was airlifted to the hospital, and put into emergency surgery. I had broken my neck and completely severed my spinal cord, C5/C6 for those interested. I was left paralyzed from the sternum down and with paralyzed hands. My arms still move, albeit weaker, but my hands are completely paralyzed.

Let me reiterate that last part: **my hands are paralyzed**.

And honestly? And I mean this from the bottom of my broken little heart, that‚Äôs the worst part. Yeah, I can‚Äôt walk, I can‚Äôt roll over in bed to find a more comfortable position, I‚Äôm stuck in a power chair, but my *hands*. I can‚Äôt pick things up, I can‚Äôt make myself a meal, I can‚Äôt use a normal computer, but worst of all? I can‚Äôt paint. I‚Äôm a watercolor artist. I used to paint very small, very detailed paintings inspired by cartoons. I can still paint by strapping a paintbrush to my hand and moving my whole arm, but it‚Äôs hard, painful, bittersweet and imprecise. Which, actually, kind of describes my life in general at this point. Hard, painful, bittersweet, and imprecise.

My favorite thing about myself used to be my independence, and I‚Äôve lost it all. I haven‚Äôt been anywhere aside from doctors appointments since February. I don‚Äôt have a wheelchair accessible van, I don‚Äôt have a job, I don‚Äôt have a purpose, I have a hard time even thinking about what that could be. 

There are so many losses I suffer through every day, losses of possibility. I spent a lot of time reading articles and watching videos on YouTube, seeing people do things and go places and I realize that I likely won‚Äôt ever get to do those things or see those places. I‚Äôll see medieval castles, mountain tops, great archaeological sites that I could never access in a power chair. It‚Äôs that initial moment of, ‚Äúoh cool! That would be awesome to see!‚Äú And then immediately followed up with, ‚ÄúOh‚Ä¶ Nevermind.‚Äú Every day I realize more and more of my dreams are dead.

I‚Äôm scared. I don‚Äôt know what the rest of my life is going to look like, I didn‚Äôt know what it was going to look like before the accident, but my future felt full of possibilities. And now when I think about my future, it‚Äôs just an empty space full of hospitals and doctor visits. I‚Äôm not used to being scared of life. 

I wish I had died in that car crash. This life is so hard. I don‚Äôt want this, I want my old self back. I don‚Äôt know who I am anymore.

I am so angry because a therapist should fucking know better!! The first thing you fucking do is give them your insurance information.

Long story stort: he had a brain tumor, and luckily was treatable with surgery, but he has been unable to work fulltime for years and also has been denied disability twice.  

How could a provider in good conscience continue therapy with someone knowing it would cost them that much?? She knew he was laid off and I've had my hours reduced to part time due to covid19! Literally making the situation worse for an already suicidal patient! How is this not malpractice??

o7r288,therapy,1624638211.0,"Hey Redditors,

never knew that my first use for such diverse platform would be regarding my mental health.

i lost my grandfather when i was just 12. never had i witnessed death or even sufferings of life. I grew up in a middle class family. My maternal side family always had complications, my mother and her siblings never got along even when my grandfather was on his deathbed. His passing away was the most traumatic event that scarred me for life. I started overthinking eventually about death, life, sufferings however i profoundly started having overthinking, anxiety like 2-3 years back im 2018 and 2019. last year 2020 was one of the mentally hardest moments of my life at mere age of 16, i almost broke down one night crying from all the things i overthinked upon however soon I had started to let go of all the things started meditating and actually started taking my life in control by 2021 I had accepted everything and had started to make progress and improved my quality of life.

2-3 days back my grandmother was hospitalized regarding heart failure and I had the biggest panic attack ever. I was feeling numb, depressive and broken. Almost made myself belief that she'd be dead the time i reached her, but she survived is now in ICU and is slowly recovering but at the back of my head there's always that anxiety that eating me. 

even the thought of me loosing her brings chills to spine any calls to my mom feel like they could be regarding her death. I personally still don't have enough courage to actually accept anything bad to happen to her. The anxiety is eating me out. I don't have any feeling right now except sadness or numbness. I saw my grandfather who was way more healthier in his 80's who literally could do more pushups than me suddenly drop down and become prone to bed. seeing his sufferings scarred my life, And feel like the same things would happen to my grandmother, I don't have enough courage and am living my life in that constant fear. I never actually could process grief for my grandfather and too actually for anything to happen right now in my life i don't actually think i could even have the will to overcome such blunders. I just want my grandmother to become healthy.

I need to study a lot too. I have a exam at the end of this year that actually determines my higher studies and colleges i take. I really want to study but the things happening to her i just cant focus or even think positively. she always wanted me to succeed in life but right now i cant even let go to stop thinking about her. I feel that if i study right now it would be so selfish.

The thing that probably bugs me a lot is that all of my family is taking this maturely and have even accepted for anything to happen to her. I just cant watch her in vain or have enough courage to accept her death and also am in trouble of my studies all of these things combined with my lack of friends and belief system is actually making me hit a rock bottom. Few of my cousins are even too chill about things happening to her yet i don't even have the courage to think about my grandmother.

**I would love if anyone could just become friends with me or  even reply with kind positive words to this post and actually would love if anyone who has suffered grief to actually help me deal with this.**

j2pl48,therapy,1601483788.0,"A little context, my brother (30M) has some emotional issues which stem from or at least are related to substance abuse (mostly weed/alcohol we think, but to a destructive level).  I (33F) finally talked my family into trying group therapy to talk about some ongoing issues which stem from his behavior, particularly because he still lives at home with my parents.  I'm on the periphery as I live out of state but I know how hurtful his behavior is to himself, my parents, and myself when I visit.  I suggested family therapy to try to get us all out of this repeated cycle of disappointment, resentment, frustration, and toxic behaviors.

Anyway, during the first session where we were all present, he was playing with his phone a lot and at a couple of points left the room to ""use the bathroom"".  While he was out of the room, the therapist did his best not to discuss him behind his back, and later addressed a few topics that came up while he was away.  Most of the hour-long session was my brother deflecting and avoiding issues and wondering out loud why we were only talking about his behavior and no one else's.  He felt attacked and was clearly on the defense.  I get it.  But he made no attempts to have a conversation, showed absolutely no interest in participating in this session.

The next day, my mom revealed to me after my brother revealed to her that he was secretly recording parts of the session and especially when he had left the room.  I feel like this is a real breach of an ""unwritten contract"" of therapy, especially in a group setting.  He made no effort to talk or reflect during our time together, but wanted to record so he could spy on us while he interrupted our session in hopes of what, blackmailing us later?  I really try to be patient with him and understand things from his perspective, but this may be the last straw.  There really isn't much action to take other than to further detach from him, I'm just hurt and angry about it.

Today, my sisters and I ordered some food from a place (first time) and it turned out to be two hours late.

The restaurant is extremely close by (a maximum of 15 minutes away) and it's early in the day where there's not a lot of customers.

The delivery guy got lost at some point, after the first hour and a half and repeatedly sending them our location, we called customer service and told them to cancel our order. They informed us that the delivery man has arrived and he's coming upstairs.

We waited another 40 minutes after that and then he came. we checked the food, it was barely warm and hardened. We told him to take it back and that we don't want it.

This entire time, my eldest sister was dealing with them on the phone. I simply watched her. She told me to check if the food was hot and I told her not really. After the guy left, he came back and gave us the phone of customer service and they kept chatting with my sister, offering her to take the food for free or to send another order. She refused both and said she didn't want the food.

It's been hours since then and I'm on the verge of a panic attack everytime I remember it. I regret telling her the food wasn't warm and I regret not telling her to just accept the food. I keep imagining how the delivery guy will be scolded and having slight urges to harm myself, as if it would make up for what happened.

I'm aware that being diagnosed/living with something like bipolar disorder or complex PTSD must definitely be life-impacting for many people, so I don't mean this insensitively, but my observation is:

So many of my friends/family constantly post on social media about their label. They will post screenshots about it, tips for people on interacting with them, etc. They will use hashtags like #CPTSDwarrior and stuff. 

They almost become completely unable to have any kind of conversation without working their label into it somehow.  

It feels like many of them also blame behavior on their label that might not necessarily be connected. 

It feels like what used to be them as a person is now gone, replaced by someone who wants to talk about this label... all the time.

I thought it would go away or lessen over time, but years later, it hasn't.

I'm definitely understanding that mental health is difficult- I also see a therapist and am working on myself. So I have empathy. I just couldn't imagine making my label my entire personality, as it seems some people in my life have. I'm not the only one who notices this.

I get that it also might be happening because they feel relief with the diagnosis, and have stuffed down feelings for many years.

lm65te,therapy,1613599892.0,"I've spent half my life (I'm 29 now) going to therapy at least once a month, sometimes once a week. After going around to over 20 different therapists and finally landing on a good one, she was unable to help me.

I realized that I had trauma from my childhood that I've been carrying through adulthood. I found out I have issues with my mother and father and most of my family that was around when I was very young. Long story short, I found out I have an anxiety driven attachment style. My therapist for the last 5 years never made this clear that this is what she thought could be the cause of my pain and suffering. She specializes in childhood trauma.

Not only this, but she ignored me for over a week while I was feeling suicidal. I confronted her about this today and she told me she has over 60 clients that she sees weekly. I asked her if she thought having so many clients might be spreading her too thin and if that could be effecting the effectiveness of her therapy. She said ""Possibly..""

Meanwhile, just hours before our final session, I learned that all my pain and suffering as an adult comes from trauma that I experienced as a child.

Can anyone really justify therapy when there are so many free resources out there that can help that don't involve ""going for a walk to calm down"" or ""breathing exercises""? I got to the root of everything in just an hour of googling, yet before this, I went through dozens of therapists and counselors and courses that could not get me here.

Is it really just me, or is therapy a scam?

1. Journaling. I try and make 2-3 entries a week, usually before/after the therapy session, and I will also make an entry if I feel particularly upset/worried by something, or can‚Äôt sleep. Think it has helped to clarify thoughts and also see what I‚Äôve been talking about in therapy in action a bit more to solidify what I‚Äôm learning and patterns

2. Meditation. I know, I know, everyone bangs on about it and it‚Äôs boring. But I find checking in daily really important for grounding, regulating the nervous system, taking a step back to observe feelings, giving self space to feel feelings, etc. Benefits don‚Äôt always feel immediately tangible but looking back over the last 6 months I think it has made a difference

3. Exercise. I try to raise heart beat every other day. Easier now gyms are open, but there is always running, weights, and routines using own body weight 

4. Walking. I‚Äôm v lucky that I live near a park that has some wooded parts. Whenever I feel on the edge, I get out, whatever the weather. Ditto if I wake up ridiculously early. Also good if I cannot being myself to exercise/having a rest day

5. Paying extra attention to self-care. Yeah, it feels really self-indulgent, but also so what? I give myself the chance to have 8 hours sleep, even if I don‚Äôt always make it. I try to eat a few fruit and veg everyday. I have a salt bath once a week

6. Talking to friends about how I‚Äôm feeling. Not easy at all. In fact, really fucking hard and one of the hardest parts of the whole process (for me). And sometimes people don‚Äôt react well at all. But sometimes they really come through for you and when that happens, it‚Äôs invaluable. Of trauma happens in relationships, we heal in relationships

I committed what‚Äôs called indecent assault a few years ago and I‚Äôve already talked about it with my therapist. Moving past and, more importantly, dealing with the underlying problems that led to it are so important. I know what the problem is (I‚Äôm very very very impulsive, in a broad sense) but I haven‚Äôt done the work needed to deal with it. 

Then this past summer I had another incident, with a girl. We were doing brunch and drinking and she was taking adderal (we‚Äôre both adhd but I‚Äôm not on stuff atm). Anyways she got bad fast. I‚Äôve never seen that but it was confusing. Anyways she kissed me first and then later I was pushing for stuff and trying to make out and I realized afterwards it was bad. She was barely awake and then jumping and calling people and doing things everything 10 minutes or something. I didn‚Äôt realize then but I did later and I reached out and asked but she said I didn‚Äôt make her uncomfortable (I‚Äôm not sure how) and was like ‚Äúwhen are we hanging out again‚Äù. 

Regardless I am not ok with this. I‚Äôm not ok with being that kind of person. For a while I just thought maybe she actually wasn‚Äôt uncomfortable.

dl71dk,therapy,1571692307.0,"It gets better. Let me explain:

Almost half a year ago, I was there myself. Self-harming frequently and daily, suicidal, depressed, insomniac, and failing classes for the first time in my life. I was put in a psych ward for 3 weeks following my suicide attempt in the spring. During those weeks, I briefly became psychotic, though only for a day or two. While there, I made a massive notepad of everything in my head. All my demons, all my thoughts, everything wrong with me. While in there, I thought it was over, and had hated every moment of my existence up until that point for the past 2 years. Acquaintances were dropping like flies from their own suicide, and a mere 2 years earlier my only and best friend Erik had committed suicide. Point is, I was about as low as one can go. When I got out, I copied the most important parts of that notebook into a text document that I still update and revise to this day, coolio.txt.

I'm not sure what it was, I think it was a collection of things, that made my mental state turn around, but by the time I left that place I was no longer suicidal, though all the other issues persisted. I was in a stupor for my first week out, but eventually set my foot down, steeled what little of my will I had left, and stopped cutting. I didn't know it then, I was just trying to fix myself, but that would be the beginning of a massive shift in momentum that leads me to where I am today, writing this post. Through the course of that summer, I would successfully kick cutting, train myself to control my dreams to avoid the nightmares that were the cause of my insomnia, and grow leaps and bounds as a person. While I'm still introverted to an extreme, I have enough confidence to make myself presentable and to start opening my personality to people.

Now to where I am now: Consistently getting 4 hours of sleep a night, sometimes 6 (huge progress from rolling a die from 0 to 4), No longer suicidal or self-harming, and finally made a friend, 3 years post-Erik. While I'm still very depressed, and have so much to figure out, including 4 dense pages of coolio.txt, I'm on the upward path. One could say I hit rock bottom so hard I bounced.

If you yourself are at rock bottom, know these words:

You matter.

You are cared for.

If you die, people will miss you. They'll feel sad. People you know, people you don't. You may feel invisible, but you're not.

Everyone is flawed, in their own different ways. You aren't a terrible person for that.

The world is going to push you down, it'll try and keep you there. It'll try to kill you through your own mind. Don't let it, stand up, no matter how damaged and flawed you may be, and say ""**No, do it yourself, coward**"".

And most importantly: **You will survive**. **You will escape. You will emerge, victorious over your demons.**",https://www.reddit.com/r/therapy/comments/dl71dk/to_anyone_whos_at_rock_bottom/,To anyone who's at rock bottom:,,85,5,0.96
ta9w7z,therapy,1646838725.0,"As a therapist, I work with adults almost exclusively. I've run into many clients that struggle to talk. I mean, I get it. I'm sitting in the room quietly with you, asking you questions repeatedly in an attempt to open you up. I'm practically staring at you, because I don't want to avert my eyes for too long and have you make an assumption of that. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to understand that the dynamic might be uncomfortable for a lot of people.... and it's uncomfortable for me too to know that my client is uncomfortable *just being there*. 

So in my sessions, sometimes we: build models, do puzzles, knit, or draw. Sometimes I set up a jug and with a handful of pennies, we spend the session attempting to throw them in. We build lego sets. Hell someone has even brought in their childhood hotwheels and we built a track. Having a task to focus on or do together helps the conversation flow. There's a place to focus your eyes, mine also; there's something to do with your hands. 

If you struggle to open up as a client, make the request to do an activity during session. If you are a therapist and have a client struggling to open up, ask if they'd prefer an activity, and make a few suggestions. There are projects *all over* my office that are in-progress with my clients. During the better-weather seasons, we go for walks, or sit outside on a bench. Sometimes we meet at the dog park too, and play fetch with their animal. 

Not every person can handle a therapeutic conversation in a traditional format *and there is nothing wrong with that*. But when I started integrating projects or activities into sessions more regularly... the whole dynamic would change for the better. With consistent use of projects, these more 'traditional' sessions started to feel comfortable for the client... now every now and then, we do just sit and talk. But that's not the goal. The goal is for therapy to feel comfortable enough for the client to get something out of it. Being rigid and sticking to a traditional format, when it isn't working, is a waste of a client's time and money.

They hardly spend time together. They don't have anything nice to say about the other. Chores are very much divided by traditional gender roles, they don't do anything for the other ""just because"". Their ideologies aren't even remarkably compatible. This has been true for as far back as I can remember. (They are capable of love. Doesn't mean either of them are good at it.)

I haven't even heard stories of them being in love. I have no clue how they met. No proposal/wedding stories. Nothing. In high school, my class was given a ""fun"" assignment about love, and we had to get responses to questions like, ""what is love,"" and,""how did you know you were in love,"" from both parents. I dreaded it so much, but I was curious for the answers, so I just put the sheet on my mother's desk and didn't say anything about it. When I got the sheet back the specific questions were left blank and the general questions had cliche answers. I couldn't tell if my father had also answered the questions or if my mother had answered twice in different handwritings. (We're not the type of family to talk about feelings.)

I have two older siblings (34&32). The oldest is developmentally disabled and lives at home (perpetually five, can be self-sufficient, but requires lots of supervision). When my parents no longer sleep in the same room, I wonder if responsibility for my sibling is keeping them together. My other sibling is married with kids. I wonder if their relationship is headed down the same path as my parents'. I was not planned. I've been told this, in a joking tone, but it's obviously true. I wonder how I fit in to the trajectory of my parents' relationship. I wonder if I've been left romantically stunted from lacking examples of healthy relationships.

I don't want to dig into the topic with my family out of fear of severing the remaining threads and having to face the fallout. So here I am.

Meanwhile, I'm reliving horrific memories, bawling my eyes out, etc. But she's on her phone. She puts it down when I come out of it, but then she's right back on it when I go back under. She seems to not want to have traditional talk therapy sessions anymore because it's just easier to put me under EMDR and not have to use critical thinking. Plus, I feel she loses track of time while I'm under which is never a good thing to do because memories can become too overwhelming.

2) Something makes me think she likely cares more about the business side of things. I've expressed my money concerns with her pretty much every session. My sweet mom is supporting me on her meager teacher retirement earnings and we're barely making ends meet. Yet, when I bring this up to my therapist, she says, ""But, she's doing okay. And she'd want you to see me as often as you need."" I've been cancelling more appointments because they're $150 per session, so that I see her once a month or so, but she's always like ""wow, I assume you've been doing really well because I haven't seen you in forever."" Yeah, because it's horribly expensive and my insurance is terrible.

3) she forgets a lot of little details about me and I always have to repeat myself each session

4) she always makes sure I pay first (and spends a few minutes of therapy time processing the payment),

5) she has NEVER been on time (the appointments are supposed to start at 1 but I don't see her until 1:10)

6) she always looks at the clock when I'm talking

7) she likes to prepare a shake or snack and eats/drinks it in front of me.

8) she's not very objective and is often biased

Am I overreacting?

eas7dn,therapy,1576371736.0,"I was finally brave enough to make an appointment. She called me to have a chat (was suppose to be half an hour) to see if we would be a good fit for each other. I knew the possibility was going to be there that we didn't work well together but I didn't think I would feel like suicide would be the better option after talking to someone.

I cry easily. I know it's a problem I'm very aware of it and struggle with dealing with it. The second she started asking a few serious questions I was crying. I know it's frustrating but she was absolutely annoyed about it. Explaining how I should stop and just speak to her normally because we don't have much time and she would like to end the call asap.

It was awful. She interrupted me in every sentance so I didn't feel like I was being heard or listened to. And told me I would be better off in a hospital so I can get given medication. Im not a doctor but talking to someone openly who could understand my problems a bit would already help me a lot. I don't want to be put on any medication before that as I know my problems are large but fixable.

Anyways she ended the call after 15 min saying we aren't a good fit. I agree but she just said many things that were just awful. And then with just a simple good bye she hung up.

Now I just don't think I have it in me to call someone else. I know I should but it took me months to build up enough courage to call this person.

But I miss growing up in 2004-2007 so much that sometimes all I do is watch nostalgic videos from that time period and feel depressed.

I miss when not every single fucking thing on the internet was monetized and I would stay up all night watching Youtube videos of content creators who did it just for the fun rather than the fame. I miss when the internet was made and ran by people with passion projects rather than corporations trying to cash in.

I miss when malls were still bustling and every Friday evening after school I would stroll through it just taking in the sounds and smells. I miss my lazy weekends when I'd just lay in bed and watch MTV or Nickelodeon for hours. I miss when your political views didn't define your whole entire identity and social worth.

But most of all, I miss when social media didn't exist and everything felt so much more mysterious and interesting. I used to think it was so incredibly cool that I could hear radio waves from Mexico sometimes when I lived near the border. Now it's nothing because there are thousands of Mexican channels up on Youtube I can watch at anytime. I get that it's made things more convenient, but at the same time, nothing feels fascinating anymore. Nothing feels wonderful or romantic or special. I think I would be willing to trade the convenience that social media offers us in order to get that spark back. I don't care about the convenience at all; I just miss the magic of life.

I look back on those times and I honestly don't think I can ever be happy in this era. I don't know if it's just because I'm an adult now, but it hurts so bad that it's sometimes debilitating.

I flew out to California to meet her. The whole experience was great. Anyways we had a couple more amazing trips and started dating. A year later she moved out to me.

Before we got married I made sure she was ready for all of it. She said she was and was excited. We went through with it and then the issue came. Guys from work would give her attention and she would tell them to stop, but kept talking to them outside of work and they got worse. I let her know i was a little uncomfortable and she picked them over me. Later she said she had feelings for another man. I was devastated.

gzmc1n,therapy,1591706335.0,"For context, I started seeing this therapist in May 2019 because I was depressed and generally feeling bad about my life. I told myself I'd invest time and money into this work for a year no matter how hard it gets, and then I'll see whether I want to continue. My therapist has always known this, I told him from the start. 

I went through very rough patches during this year, and regularly had panic attacks during and after sessions, which never happened before. All of these were accompanied by immense anger towards my therapist for staying silent and refusing to give me any tools to break from these moments where I felt stuck in my head. He would sometime ask me about my childhood experience with anger, or anxiety, but I never felt like this worsening anxiety was addressed. I made it clear, in spoken words.

I stuck with it until May, when I told him that I want us to plan the end of our work. Even though I have a stronger sense of self and better relationships than where I started, I also feel that therapy is now harming me more than it's helping. It takes me several days to a week to recover from sessions.

My therapist refused we stop now. He wants to go on until at least September. When asked, he refused to tell me why. He refused to explain what work he felt was still needed. He refused to give me any sense of perspective, or help me understand anything about what we're doing, or why I should still do this to myself. When I describe my most recent panic attacks, and say I don't find this therapeutic, he just nods like he knows something about it but leaves me in the dark entirely.

He wants to close out our work properly with some closing sessions, which I want as well, but he wants to decide that time himself. 

I feel like I'm going insane. Whenever I think about his silence and my complete lack of understanding of the path our work is taking, I trigger another attack. My mental state is deteriorating, I feel like I'm going crazy. Is it normal for therapists to leave patients in the dark? Am I missing something here?

flmib8,therapy,1584669201.0,"If you‚Äôre a survivor, chances are you have been victim blamed/shamed. In the past when it came to sexual assault, it was often the woman that was blamed for ‚Äúasking for it.‚Äù I recall reading a book called ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt Buy My Love‚Äù that talked about the influence of advertisements. There was a specific rape case where the judge ruled that the woman asked for it simply because the brand of her underwear was Victoria‚Äôs Secret. Now, we are finally holding men accountable for sexual assault, but why not for abuse? There is a stereotype that low income or minority females are too ‚Äúuneducated‚Äù to not leave. This is false. Abuse can happen to ANYONE of any social class or ethnicity. Abuse is rarely shown right away. I‚Äôm sure if we saw it in the first week we would have run but that simply isn‚Äôt how it works, especially in narcissistic abuse. There is a ‚Äúlove bombing‚Äù or ‚Äúgolden period‚Äù that can last up to a year or more where the narc acts perfectly, the change in their behavior starts slowly and is a brainwash process that has us hold onto the love bomb period in the hopes of them being capable of being that way again. Once brainwash is complete, abuse is the new normal and the voice in your head telling you something wrong is still there but yet you feel trapped to leave. I‚Äôve learned a lot about this type of abuse from this account \*\*@he\_never\_hit\_me\_but\*\* dedicated narcissistic abuse survivors.

TLDR: Therapist told me, F22, with a fear of men due to multiple SAs from ages 12 and up, that when I‚Äôm anxious I should just ‚Äúremember that jesus is here and will keep me safe.‚Äù

This is not my first therapy rodeo. I have gone to therapy ever since I was a teenager because of different sexual assaults that I experienced and was given a diagnosis of PTSD, anxiety, and depression when I was 17 years old. I‚Äôve just now been medicated after years of trying to do just therapy, but my general practitioner recommended that I still do therapy just in case something goes haywire with the meds. My doctor told me that I must see this therapist that she recommended for at least one session to be prescribed meds, and despite some red flags, I continue to see them out of laziness. And just the fact that it‚Äôs hard for me to open up so many times to new therapists. 

Each session we start with a prayer. I am a Christian and live in a extremely conservative Christian town, but I am far more liberal than most Christians and do not subscribe to the belief that an immortal being is continuously watching over every single person on this planet 24/7. That sorta stemmed from my trauma: why would god watch these horrible things happen to me but do nothing? Especially when I was a child? I don‚Äôt pray often but choose to do it with others and starting off sessions with prayers didn‚Äôt necessarily bug me. But what did bug me is she never asked me if we could start with prayer‚Ä¶ and because my doctor told me I couldn‚Äôt get refills of my meds without seeing this therapist that she knows at least once or twice, I just grinned, bowed my head and beared it. 

HOWEVER, it was very clear that this therapist was far more passionate than any others I‚Äôve experienced. She would tell me her opinions on people and situations ‚Äúforcefully‚Äú as I described it to friends and family. But our last session I feel as though she crossed a line. 

I was describing to her that when I experience a high of emotion, it is accompanied by heightened anxiety . For example, if I‚Äôm extremely happy or extremely excited, it‚Äôll make me anxious. If I experience a lot of emotions or heightened emotions in the day, I feel close to having an anxiety attack. I told her I wasn‚Äôt sure if this was the meds, or if the meds were silencing my generalized anxiety thoughts, or unrealistic fears‚Ä¶ For example, when I wasn‚Äôt medicated, my anxiety would be over improbable things. ‚Äúwhat if a meteor hits the house, or what if the kitchen is on fire right now, or maybe my car is wrecked in the parking lot because somebody hit it‚Ä¶‚Äù I thought maybe the THOUGHTS were silenced by the meds but the feelings were still there? 

My therapist told me that when she experiences anxiety that she just remembers that Jesus and God are with her every day, every minute, every hour. And that she cannot escape them. They are always with her, and when she is extremely anxious, she will imagine them holding her hand, giving her a hug, or patting her head. She then recommended that I try this when I‚Äôm feeling nervous and am home alone or without my husband. And to imagine god saying to me ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre safe. There is nothing to be afraid of!‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt really respond. I actually shut down and felt a barrier come up between her and I. I should have known, after my first post on her on Reddit that she wasn‚Äôt a good fit (TLDR: she told me my father is a pedo and my younger sister is in danger but did not provide any information on how I can help keep her safe). Her comment on religion triggered my PTSD to the point where I was experiencing flashbacks, physical sensations of touch, but an added image of a white man in a white robe stroking my hair and telling me I‚Äôm okay while I‚Äôm being assaulted. 

I‚Äôm not going back to her. I scheduled another session because my body and brain were on autopilot, but that will be my last. I don‚Äôt even remember what my response to her thoughts were. But right now? I‚Äôm angry. Angry that this woman just said what she felt like was helpful despite knowing my problems with men, problems with my father and without knowing whether or not I was a Christian. I‚Äôve never brought up god in sessions. I‚Äôve never made comments or shared stories about church. She just assumed, presumably because I never objected to prayer. 

I‚Äôm not sure if I should be honest when I end our sessions together, or just say that I can‚Äôt continue therapy at this time and make up some excuse. But I wanted to share because while this woman retraumatized me, I know I still need help to process my trauma and cope. If you‚Äôve ever experienced a therapist that did more harm than good‚Ä¶ know that you are not alone. And that it‚Äôs OK to end therapy with that person. 

I am OK. I am definitely pretty foggy, or disassociating frequently today, but I am safe and I am aware that I am safe. If you made it this far, please share your thoughts and what you would do if you were me, because I‚Äôm not sure how I want to end things with her.",https://www.reddit.com/r/therapy/comments/urr7b7/my_therapist_traumatized_me/,My therapist traumatized me,,79,19,0.95

I have little to no doubt that I am a pedophile. After I realized this a few weeks ago, life has just gotten terrible and just sad. I now am going through the stereotypical emo phase with somewhat dark clothing, edginess, being depressed and super pessimistic.

I have been having some suicidal thoughts over the last few months but nothing with self-harm. I wish that something outside would take me out, like a car crash. I have done very little drug abuse over the last few years (one cup of lean) and I don't have an addiction or anything like that.

I don't know if this is related but I have this sense of impending doom when I turn 18. It's almost like I end up dead or in prison when I turn 18. I am also having some short-term memory loss which gets annoying after a bit.

-I have heard of POCD and I don't think that it's that. My symptoms just don't match with it. 

-I know some people might think that since I haven't hurt anyone that its fine and I just have to accept my attraction. I don't think that I could live with myself if I accepted it. 

I am not big on self-pity but I don't know why I deserve this. No one wants to be part of the most hated group in history. I guess I am just getting it off my chest. I am not sure what I will do with the rest of my life with being a pedophile. I did want kids for a bit but I can't get myself to convince myself that it would be fine to have kids

So fast forward 3 months later the other day we were at this nice cabin on vacation by the ocean it was a good day my anxiety was better then usual we started to get intimate and this time actually made it to actually having sex not just for-play well I had a panic in the middle of actually having sex I had a major panic attack AGAIN I‚Äôm feeling lost and it‚Äôs affecting my husband I can see it‚Äôs bothering him and I‚Äôm feeling quite ashamed and like a freak.

The year is 2001, I was born into a family who didn‚Äôt want me used me as a slave. My father was a drug addict and dealer and my mother left when i was 3. She was also consumed by drugs and would rather pursue that over her kid.

From the time i was 4 until i turned 14 i was stuck going back and forth between my Dad and Grandmother. They would get protective orders against each-other and it resulted in us being moves from house to house. At 8 years old I was forced to work for my dad doing HVAC after school, sometimes not getting home until after midnight. That continued until I was 12, then i was forced to take over a paper route my step-mother no longer wanted. We lived in a 2 bedroom apartment and it consisted of Me, my sister, 3 younger brothers, step-mom, and my father. Every-night we crammed onto a couch just to sleep. 
Most days we didn‚Äôt have food because my father and step mom had drug problems. I had income from my paper route but it was taken from my father every week. We got aid from the state such as food stamps and wic but my parents would sell it for cash to buy drugs and clothes and whatever else they wanted.
The whole time we lived here I missed school. From 6th grade to 8th grade i went a total of 193 days.

December of 2013 our apartment burned down and we lost everything. During this time I got placed with my grandparents because my father stuck his dick in my ear an took pictures of it. My grandmother received the photos and had my father arrested. (He got out 2 days later and was never charged) 

Remember when i said i wasn‚Äôt going to school?
Yeah that caught up to me and i was sent away March 4 of 2014. I was placed in states custody for 90 days until the state could find a place to put me. During this time I succeeded in school getting the best grades ive ever had. Sadly thats where my good luck ran out. I was placed with my mother in June and it didn‚Äôt last long. I was kicked out of my house for getting addicted to drugs. I was home for 3 weeks before I started selling and doing Xanax. 

Fast forward to 2016. Im in high-school, but its my second almost third time being a freshman. I still wasn‚Äôt going to school. My mother rented an apartment but never stayed there. So i did. I would party and just generally destroy the apartment. Well eventually my mom quit paying the bills. So I got a ‚Äúreal‚Äù job at taco bell. In the 2 months that i worked there i got hooked on cocaine. I wasn‚Äôt going to school again and my manger knew, so she scheduled me more and more. Most days i worked night shift which was about 11 hours. Sometimes i would work open to close because we were short staffed. Coke fueled my ability to work. 

March,3rd 2017, i was sent to a psychiatric ward for a week from having panic attacks caused by my drug use. 

Fast forward again to October 31st, 2017. Im in court for truancy and guess what? I got sent away. By this time i was smoking crack, snorting anything i could get my hands on plus selling a-lot of stolen drugs from my dealer. Anyway Im on my way to placement for the second time. 

You want to know what scarred me the most? I had to take multiple drug test. You know why that scarred me? My family would finally see that i was just like them. I was trash. My mother got the report and it stated everything i failed for. Want the list? Here you go.

Herion
Cocaine 
Xanax 
Weed
MDMA
GHB
And my favorite: Ketamine 

During my time is placement i did really well i school once again. However i kept getting in trouble. Fighting other kids at the facility, staff and even a few visitors.
I got caught with a cellphone which is a big no no. I got the option to take my TASC test which is the GED Test in my state. I passed it in about 4 weeks and was allowed to go home. Problem was i had no home to go to. So i asked my dad if i could stay with him. Sounds dumb right? Yeah i know and it didn‚Äôt last long. We eventually got into a fist fight and long story short he beat my ass to a pulp. After this happened my best friend said ‚Äúhey you can move in with me‚Äù 

So, it march of 2018, I‚Äôm staying with my friend but i feel like a burden to his family. So i left. I moved in with my sister. And I‚Äôve lived with her ever since. Im starting to feel like a burden to her as well. Once i moved in with her i got my shit together and started working full-time. Doing? You guessed it HVAC. The thing that started all my issues has finally come back. 

Now cut to December of 2019. I got laid off due to ‚Äúlack of work‚Äù and my car broke down.  Current date is 1/9/20 and my car is still broke down and i still haven‚Äôt found a job. Its currently 5:14 am and I‚Äôm about to enjoy my last cigarette ever. 

I know people may never read this and that ok. Its more for me to come to peace with my self. If you took the to read this, thank you from the bottom of my heart because thats the first time anyone has ever cared enough about me to hear my story.

1.) moved out in March 2020 and living by myself (27/F). This is the first time me living on my own, no family members and no roommates.
2.) came out officially to friends and my mom after many years of suppressing my sexuality without telling a soul (except Reddit). Positive and supportive reactions from all. 
3.) a lot of dating, a lot of firsts with women, and a lot of rejections. Possibly could be burned out by dating. I had this naive notion that once I came out everything would be smooth sailing from here. I‚Äôll somehow find the love of my life but dating has been rough. 

2020 was not a bad year for me, it was a lot of my stepping outside of my comfort zone but for some reason I still feel sad and alone. It goes in waves, there are some moments when I‚Äôm happy as fuck and then there are moments where I‚Äôm just sad and empty inside. I have been having random crying spells and anxiety. 

I used to smoke every other day before bed but now smoking gets me paranoid or gives me anxiety and sometimes makes me cry. 

I really would like to get into therapy but sometimes I feel a bit ridiculous for going to therapy. My life isn‚Äôt bad.

He convulsed for a few minutes and then stopped breathing for almost 2 minutes. I know you're not supposed to do cpr on someone seizing but he wasn't moving or breathing for what felt like an eternity after convulsing, I thought I lost him and I dicided to give him cpr. I've been certified before in the past. After trying my best he started coughing up all this phlem and began to breath again. Later on after he arrived at the hospital he had another seizure.

The doctors weren't really telling me much over the phone all day and I wasn't allowed to go because of covid. I've had to deal with hospitals a lot before growing up with an autoimmune disease and both of my sister's have had extremely rare life threatening autoimmune diseases. I found out it was caused by alcohol withdrawal. He never showed any signs of being that severe of a drinker, I knew he drank but what I was told was way more than I ever thought by the doctor. I've been around alcoholics all my life working at bars and living with roommates, my husband never acted or showed the signs or even a warning this would happen. I was trying to ask what I could do afterwards to help him when he is able to leave in a few days and it broke my heart when the doctor told me I probably couldn't afford rehab and also said that I probably wouldn't find any aa programs. What am I supposed to do?  How can our system of health care be so messed up. This country doesn't care about it's people. What if he just sneaks alcohol and dies this time because I couldn't help him or get him help? Do they just want me to watch him drink himself to death?

hfep50,therapy,1593053469.0,"Long story short I‚Äôm a biracial, 24 year old female from a predominantly white town. Since the BLM movement has blown up after the unjust death of George Floyd, I‚Äôve been very vocal online about my support. I‚Äôve spent about 5 days each week protesting for hours. But that‚Äôs not why I‚Äôm exhausted.

I‚Äôm emotionally burnt out. I cry every day thinking about the state of the world and how so many marginalized people (not even just the black community) are living in constant fear when all that has to happen to change that is quite literally people CHOOSING to be better people and CHOOSING to change as a society. Because quite literally nothing is keeping us living this way except ourselves. Almost everything we do is based on a human‚Äôs idea- paying rent, working 40 hours a week, etc. I feel like NOTHING i am doing is changing anything. And I know my feelings are valid but also, I see other people living carefree like nothing is happening right now and it hurts because it makes me feel like they don‚Äôt care about ME. I‚Äôve cut off many friends I‚Äôve known since middle school for not voicing support for the movement because it‚Äôs quite literally a fight for MY civil and human rights as a BLACK woman. It hurts reading things online from people I loved opposing my freedoms and supporting my oppression. It hurts realizing these people I have always adored and supported have been thinking less of me this whole time because of the color of my skin. I am crumbling. And no amount of self-reflecting can tell me what the right thing to do is. I can‚Äôt take this anymore. I can‚Äôt cry myself to sleep every night and put on a brave face tomorrow watching videos of people who look like me and the people i love being murdered. I can‚Äôt get online and see entire thinkpieces about how myself and my black brothers + sisters are ‚Äúthugs‚Äù or ‚Äúanimals‚Äù. I know despite these ignorant people, the world is still progressing in little ways but it doesn‚Äôt feel like it enough... I don‚Äôt understand how anyone could support the unjust treatment of any human regardless of gender, racer, sexual orientation, etc. We have ONE life. Why shouldn‚Äôt we each be able to live it how we want without the constraints of judgement from others or even worse, systemic oppression. Realizing how many people are just hateful for no valid reason is quite literally killing me...

Anyways, I‚Äôm bipolar and was THRIVING mentally before this started but now I have regular thoughts of suicide again. I just don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. I don‚Äôt want to exist in a world of hatred. I dont want to feel inferior or live knowing people around me think see me that way. I‚Äôm exhausted and I really can‚Äôt do this anymore. I feel I need to move out of this town and maybe i‚Äôll find more like-minded people. But I don‚Äôt have the money (or social skills lol). I was laid off during covid which was a blessing in disguise because i realized i hated my career (waste of 4 years of college) and i needed time to breathe but I don‚Äôt have a job to keep me busy so I spend most of my energy at the gym trying to at least feel good about myself which isn‚Äôt working because my self-esteem is eternally in the garbage no matter what. I don‚Äôt even want to hang out with the few friends I have left because I just don‚Äôt have the energy. And when I do hang out with them, all I have to talk about is protesting because that‚Äôs all I‚Äôve been doing. And I know that‚Äôs not enjoyable for everyone. I‚Äôve made a few new ones but my social anxiety makes me terrified I‚Äôll disappoint them when they get to know me or they just won‚Äôt like me. It‚Äôs all just a lot at once. It‚Äôs mostly the world stuff that‚Äôs bothering me (i think) but all the other everyday shit on top of it is just so heavy i haven‚Äôt gotten out of bed all day except to stress eat.

I know I sound dramatic because I know it‚Äôs a global movement and it‚Äôs WAY bigger than me but the reality of it is, it affects people like me personally. On an individual level.

Think of it more, as a whale, submerged far below the surface. Trying to reach air again is a vital requirement. Alone, a whale will begin to lose its drive and focus, sinking without anyone helping them reach the surface. Therapy helps you focus on surfacing, and reminds you to keep your eyes looking upwards, even if you start sinking again. They help you look out for the tides that push you further down, and find ones that help you up. As you continue to get closer to the surface, you might jump in and out of the water a bit, and that‚Äôs okay.

My therapist sends me the zoom invitation often a few minutes after my session is supposed to start.  She then becomes annoyed if I can't get the speakers to work correctly or if there are other technical issues.

Last week she sent me the request over 5 minutes into the hour and I told her my workplace had contacted me (they hadn't).  I told her I was now not available.

She emailed me repeatedly.  She told me her last session went ""long"" (mine never does even when she's late).

My time is as important as hers.  I also think she should be building a  buffer into session times so that she has a few or more minutes between sessions so she can collect her thoughts, get ready, etc.

I made the decision to not attend anymore sessions with her.

n2dy5y,therapy,1619856206.0,"I am twenty-two years old, a female. I'll mention that I have maladaptive daydreams since I was four or five and had limerence in the past. So I do daydream constantly and can be too attached to real people. I had unrequited love, no friends, been bullied, misunderstood, and past regrets throughout my school years. My family can be emotionally abusive, brushing off my issues and argue with me when I mention them. My first real relationship lasted a year, he was amazing and he loved me despite my issues but we went our separate ways during the pandemic. I've had a little crush on fictional characters before but this is different. Since I discovered this character last year it's hard to not think about him every day. It brings me comfort and happiness when I think about him like I am not alone despite being alone. 
That is the problem, I am getting too comfortable and attached to the character. I've been trying to find friends and even a partner online, so I can be normal instead of dreaming of a romance. Sadly, most guys I met want sex, it pushed me farther away from every guy in fear of being used or abused, the nice guys don't understand me or leave after a few days. When I mentioned limerence, this happened before I met my Ex, I was too obsessed with a man who didn't and couldn't even love me. That experience left an impact on me, it made me not want to fall in love for fear of being that obsessed again. I would never want to put anyone through that. When I see the fictional character, he makes me feel good, a person I can look up to and who won't leave or hurt me. 
When I talk to real men, I don't feel anything towards them. Maybe a little uncomfortable, cautious, and expecting the person to get perverted during the conversation. I am bad at making conventions. My social skills are nonexistent, I have social anxiety, I am not good at talking to strangers. Which makes it more difficult to talk to real people. 
So after what I've experienced and been through, I fell in love with a fictional character, it hurts to admit it but I am. Is there a way I can overcome it? I want to find love and have a family someday.

Then i took 75mg of a medication used for insomnia/severe anxiety this doesn‚Äôt produce a high but it makes you sleepy and i‚Äôve found it to amplify the effects of other substances (mixing a downer and an upper not good already). then about an hour went by and I decided to drink again so I went to the kitchen and drank about 4-5 shots of of an alcohol that sounds like daniels jack (mixing dark and light idk how i didn‚Äôt puke) at this point i‚Äôm extremely drunk but decided to snort some more of the ADHD medication. i have ADHD myself so it would take a lot for me to feel the effects but at this point i‚Äôm at 180mg which is 6x the highest dose prescribed for ADHD.

At one point in the recordings I couldn‚Äôt sit up, and a bit later in it my eyes were racing and fluttering. My friends say they thought i was going to OD and watching that I think I may have. All day yesterday I was extremely tired as i got about 10 minutes of sleep but could not sleep. I have had a consistent headache since yesterday as well as severe nausea that got somewhat better today. Yesterday my face looked weird to me almost as if my facial features were all slightly different same with my body. But today that is slightly better. 

I feel like I should tell my mom but I know I would get admitted to the mental hospital and my parents would never trust me again. And i know everyone would think of me differently.  My other friend was also doing some other substances as well as some alcohol and she ended up telling her mom because it got too bad and now she was admitted to the ward. and I think I would be in the same boat if I snitch on myself but my health needs to come first so I don‚Äôt know what to do.

I'm on mobile fyi. I made some things vague and changed details because I don't want people to recognize me. 

This happened a few weeks ago. I had a phone session with my therapist where I talked about my troubles with dating. I've talked and went on socially distanced dates with many men, who have some problematic views on LGBTQ+ issues. Its been hard for me talking with these people and has taken a toll on my mental health. But I don't want to tolerate those views. I'm also bisexual so its an important issue to me. I've been asking people I talk to a specific question about an LGBTQ+ issue to weed out those people. 

My therapist then said I should stop because its their preference. But its also my preference not to tolerate it. We got in an argument and she accused me of wanting to force her to do things she didn't want to do otherwise she'd be sexist, racist, homophobic, etc. I tried to defend myself and make my point more clearer. Obviously I don't want to force anyone to do something they don't want to do. The last straw was was when he said if a man was attracted to me and talked to me, but then found out I was bisexual, he would not be homophobic if he rejected me because I was bi. She said its okay for him to feel that way. I hung up on her after that. I felt like she was telling me I should just accept and tolerate discrimination against me. I told her I'm not seeing her anymore because of the last thing she said and also twisting my words to make it a personal attack on her. 

On one hand, I feel guilty that my views have made me lose a important person in my life who I've known for 5+ years. On the other hand, I do feel like she stepped way out of line and her conduct was unprofessional so I have every right to end things. But am I right to do so?

tzya9l,therapy,1649526215.0,"This was my first therapy appointment with a clinical psychologist. 

So my therapist revealed to me that she has also gone through PTSD and trauma in the past. She practices using a trauma informed approach and has been for over a decade. 

She became aware in the first session that I am in a relationship right now during which I was sexually assaulted by someone. And I have not told my partner. I feel guilt and shame for what happened to me. 

This incident happened a little less than 3 years ago and it affects me to this day as I have not been able to tell my partner. She confided in my that she also had a similar experience and told her partner years later which brought them closer. 

Here‚Äôs the thing: 
She seemed to encourage me to leave my partner even though she knows I‚Äôm trying my best to work things out with him and with the help of therapy. (This happened in the first session). 
She also had an appointment with my partner and my partner said she said similar things to him around whether or not ‚Äúwe can have a healthy relationship.‚Äù 
She also told me that what happened to me three years ago wasn‚Äôt my fault but that I should seriously consider just leaving it in the past. (Just like she has). And not letting it affect me ‚Äúsince it was so long ago.‚Äù 

I want to tell my partner what she said to me and that I think she was highly inappropriate in my session at the very least. Am I wrong? (I haven‚Äôt done therapy before so, maybe my skin is too thin)? My partner has asked to take a break as per her insight and wants to reconsider out relationship.

Two weeks went by without any response whatsoever from her.

The first therapist also had no availability for video visits, so I decided to try a second one. I got the exact same treatment. No answers, no response, except automated system messages. There was nobody on the other end replying to me.

mzygqq,therapy,1619557127.0,"I'll do my best to not make this too long.

So here's the gist: I started going to therapy about 9 months ago since I'm fortunate enough to have insurance to make it be affordable. It's been a wonderful experience, has helped me immensely, and I LOVE my therapist. 

Since the beginning of the year my therapist has let me know he plans on opening his own private practice. I let him know what insurance I was on and he said he'd look into the paperwork for it and it was kind of left at that.

He was originally supposed to transfer to his new practice at the end of May, but last week I was informed it was going to be end of April instead. Come to find out there's been some sort of drama where his boss basically said that it needs to happen now for reasons I'm not privy to. The session following the news last week was chaotic and confusing and left me trying to figure out what exactly was going on and what that meant. When I initially found out I wasn't worried since I knew this was happening, but in our session he broke the news to me that I'm the only client he has with my insurance and that with everything going down now it's not something he's going to be sending in, making this next session the last that my insurance will cover.

I feel like the rug has been swept out from under me and I don't really know what to do. I'm mad that I've ended up being caught up in some internal work place drama and left having to figure out what to do next. Both my therapist and his soon to be former boss have offered to help me find another therapist, or he's offered me 10 sessions at a discounted rate (still significantly more expensive than what I pay currently) until we can get things figured out.

I don't know which option I should choose. I hate the idea of our relationship ending so suddenly with virtually no warning and starting all over with a new person, but I also don't know if I feel like I want to continue investing emotionally into this if it's just going to end anyways not on my terms or when I'm actually ready for it. Plus this has brought on its own loss of trust.

jyksum,therapy,1606000663.0,"Firstly, most of what I'll say here may be very disturbing, I hope no one will use it against me, just know it wasn't my choice and I'm willing to do anything to treat it, that is just better than hiding it from everyone, so I hope I won't be hated for seeking help. And I hope sexual mentions aren't against the rules.

So the problem is, I can feel sexually attracted to anyone and anything. Mostly it's if I find the person/object cute or feel comfortable with them or love them or anything that makes them significant to me. What this means is, I can feel sexual attraction to my Mac. Notice I'm using ""can"" because I can still control my feelings, but that's pretty much repressing it and I don't think it's real treatment. I'm sorry I have to make it more obvious, but it goes from a very close friend, to my pets, to my relatives, to children. I don't think I'm a pedophile, zoophile, or all of these disorders at the same time, because none of them feel special. What I mean is, the reason is never that they're a child, animal or anything, it is always because of the emotional attraction. In a way you could say I turn all kinds of love into sexual ones. Some examples of that would be feeling sexual arousment by emotionally intense conversations with my girlfriend, for example when we're telling each other that we love each other, generally when I feel safe and comfortable. Another, more disturbing example would be me feeling sexual arousment by seeing a child, of course I don't let myself feel anything, but the initial thought is there, until I almost instantly shut it down. I obviously do not like this, I do not want to be this and even though I know it isn't exactly my fault because I haven't chosen to be this, I can't stop hating myself, I feel so guilty about it and I would do anything for it to go away, for me to be normal again.

Another thing that concerns me is, I don't feel disgust by most of the disturbing things. I can talk about, and even see, anything disgusting, like cannibalism, rape etc. without much disgust. Of course I don't enjoy it, it's just that I'm pretty much numb about it, I do feel consciously sad those kind of stuff actually happen though. If it's relevant, I've been through a phase where I denied all emotions and impulses, including disgust, as a coping mechanism. That was more than a year ago though, and lasted about a year itself, gradually getting more extreme.

I hate this for so many reasons, not only does it make me a digusting person, I have to keep my self control to keep myself from doing disgusting things, and it scares me because I might lose my self control, for example because of alcohol, or not realise it's disgusting, not to mention it makes me dishonest with everyone because they don't know how I feel towards them, neither does my girlfriend. She knows this disorder of mine though, and I feel like I'm unloyal, guilty and dishonest to her. All of this really makes me hate myself. I hope someone is out there to show me how I can get better because I've done some research and couldn't find anything relevant. I can't thank anyone that's willing to help enough.

as many of you know, the process isn't easy. even though i came out and did my confrontations to my mom and sisters and told them everything i needed to say, my emotions were still shit. all it takes is one small trigger to take me back. and lo and behold, that trigger eventually came (too tiresome to type what happened, but it was a small thing but triggered me bigtime nonetheless). so im triggered, had a relapse, and i'm back to having a major depressive episode. last week, i was really conflicted about seeing my therapist (i was at that point wherein, why the fuck should i even try to be better, fuck this shit). but i still managed to somehow convinced myself to go to my appointment.

my appointment was at 4pm (we're doing online therapy bc of COVID btw). come 4:10, my therapist still wasnt there. so i texted her and told her where she is. and she replied that she FUCKING FORGOT TO SCHEDULE ME TODAY. I'm like, okay, okay, this is some annoying shit but i can still tolerate it. It was weird bc we always have the same sched (4pm every thursday). but she was a bit old, so i'll give her a bit of a leeway that maybe she just forgot. she told me give her 5 minutes. 5 minutes in she still wasn't there. she texted that we'll start at 430 because she's on the phone with a lawyer (tf does that have to do with me??). 440 pm, she still wasn't there. So i was like fuck this. I had to convince myself to go push through with the therapy sesh despite not wanting to go because i wasn't in the ""i want my life to be better"" mood, at LESS THAN ONE HOUR OF SLEEP (it was finals week, so my sleep was fucked), and this fucking happens. If this had happened on any other occasion i might be okay with it. And the fact that she kept moving the time was just really sketchy, it's as if she's REALLY trying to put off my session with her.

Bitch didn't even apologize for forgetting our schedule. When I told her that im cancelling the sesh, she just texted back ""okay, (my name)"". LIKE WOW. NO SORRY? NO APOLOGIZING? Just ""okay, thank you for reaching out but nah, figure your episode on your own"". Like god. Don't even try to defend her in the comments, cuz partly i could understand if she really forgot, but not apologizing for it? Wow. Just wow. I could handle being stood up by people.

rwr6ni,therapy,1641401216.0,"My girlfriend and I have (had) 2 bunnies (now 1), 3 mice (now 2) and one dog. Last week one of the mice died. I found her in her tube, and her sisters had found her before hand. Being that mice are omnivores and opportunistic, they ate a little of her. While there wasn't any blood, it still messed me up a little. Then last night while I was making dinner, we noticed that one of our bunnies, Lola, wasn't eating. The other bunny had left half of the food for her, which absolutely killed me. She was also pretty skinny, indicating she hadn't been eating much as of recently. She had really thick fur, so we didn't notice until my girlfriend picked her up. We gave her a bath, clipped her nails, and dried her off, hoping she might feel a little better, and maybe she'd pull through. I stayed up most of the night to keep an eye on her and told my girlfriend to try and get some sleep. Then, around 7:30 this morning, I heard her squeak in pain and came in to find her splayed out under one of the shelves in her little room. I quickly moved the shelf, making sure not to hurt her further. When I picked her up, she didn't go limp, she was twitching, but still slightly responsive. I woke up my girlfriend and we talked about what to do. For those who don't know, when you have more than one rabbit, if one dies, you have to leave it where it fell, to allow the other rabbit to understand what's happened, and to understand that they have died. So I came back into the room to see if she had gone yet and she was still twitching. I gently petted her head and saw her eye turn to me. I was sobbing at that point, but I choked out ""It's gonna be okay baby girl"" and tried not to cry harder. Then her eye rolled back a bit, and she closed it, and then she slowly stopped twitching. I sat on the couch with my girlfriend, who needed to get away, she couldn't watch, and sobbed like a baby.

Of course, these thoughts are not useful/helpful.  Most of the time, I want people to be happy.  I have worked hard to get to a place where I‚Äôm happy and have a stable life.  It took a lot of therapy and a lot of effort.  I truly want to be free of negativity and life a happy life.

For context, my mother and father are together but it's clear that the love isn't there. They shout at each other almost every day and my mom always tells me marrying him was her worst mistake. Because her relationship with my father isn't great she always tells me how much she loves me and how I'm her whole world and what not.

My mom expects me to be perfect and constantly berates me about the reasons I don‚Äôt live up to her expectations. My entire life I‚Äôve lived in fear of doing anything wrong due to her interesting fear-tactics parenting style. I have a 4.0 gpa and have never had detention or even a late assignment. In fact, I get bullied about being a ‚Äúgoody goody.‚Äù Despite all of this, my mom still thinks I‚Äôm a horrible child who is actively trying to hurt her with every word and action. With every tragedy in our lives, she immediately makes herself the victim and refuses to believe it‚Äôs affected me in anyway. I‚Äôm only fifteen and this seems to be her biggest problem with me. She often tells me I won‚Äôt be mature enough until I‚Äôm sixteen to do most things. Social media, hanging out with friends, going on dates alone, being driven places by my boyfriend, cuddling (or ‚Äúcanoodling‚Äù as she has uncomfortably named it), participating in certain things, etc are all banned until I‚Äôm exactly sixteen. I have tried to have reasonable discussions with her about these regulations by just simply trying to get a logical explanation for them, but she immediately turns to screaming at me (sometimes locking me in her closet with her to keep others from hearing) and using arguments like, ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt have a dad, so you don‚Äôt understand boys‚Äù, ‚Äúbecause I said so‚Äù, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm an adult so I would know‚Äù, ‚Äúfor my heart‚Äù, or will just burst into her own sob story and completely ignore the issue. It‚Äôs very irritating because she doesn‚Äôt trust me at all. She tracks me everywhere I go and places random and unpredictable restrictions on times, people, and places. She often calls me a slut because of the normal way i dress, tells me i‚Äôm not worth her money, and plainly stated she doesn‚Äôt like who I am as a person. Somehow all of this makes her believe that she is an amazing parent and that it‚Äôs not even possible that other people love their kids as much as she does.

tmfcm4,therapy,1648133725.0,"Last session I (27m) told my therapist (f) I had a crush on her. I brought it up not because I had any intentions of starting a social relationship, and I made that super clear from the beginning. I told her because I trusted her professional opinion and wanted her to tell me if I should seek a new therapist or if we could continue our therapeutic relationship in spite of me having those feelings. I knew she couldn't help me if I wasn't honest with her, and felt it was relevant to my treatment. 

The next day I get a call from her boss, the owner of the office, and her boss tells me that because I had those feelings for my therapist I would not be able to continue treatment with her. I expected this as a probable outcome, but what I didn't expect was for *her employer* to call and tell me. My therapist told me that we would take the week between sessions to think on the matter and discuss it at our next session. If she had told me then that I needed to seek a new therapist then I would have respected it, the whole reason I told her about my crush was so that she could advise me on the best way to continue my treatment knowing full well she would likely recommend I talk to someone different. But it's clear she went and told her boss what I had told her, because her boss called me with knowledge of the details of our conversation and told me I'd need to find a new therapist.

I'm embarrassed and humiliated. I feel like I can't show my face at that office again. If she told her boss who else did she tell? And who else might the boss had told? I was under the impression that our sessions were entirely confidential and expected her and I to talk about the matter ourselves. I trusted her to advise me on the best course of action for my treatment, not to talk to her employer about the details of our session. Was this a breach of confidentiality? If so, where should I go from here?

Edit: I wanted to thank everyone that took the time to respond, you all have really made me feel a lot better about the situation. While I do wish that my therapist themselves would have called me, I'm not as worried about the confidentiality issue anymore. I understand now that she likely needed to seek advice from her supervisor, that such a thing is normal and ethical, and she may had been a less experienced therapist a bit outside of her depth (I was told she was new to the practice and she was close to my age). I'll likely look for a new therapist at a different practice, though I apparently handled the situation well as the supervisor told me on the phone I would be placed on the waiting list to see a different therapist at the same practice. I'm committed to getting better and won't let this experience put me off of therapy.

pgt5ra,therapy,1630624930.0,"I've been with my therapist for 2 years now. The first year, when I had severe anxiety and some panic attacks, she was great - there were many sessions where I felt a LOT better after talking to her. I valued her input, respected her, and felt good about our sessions.

This past year, she's gotten goofy and too familiar. When it was around the time of the USA election, she would go off on 5 minute tangents about how horrible Trump is (I agree and I hate that man as well, but... Trump/the election was never a topic I wanted to talk about). Now that the election is long gone, she's been somewhat better, but I find she brings a good chunk of the topics I bring up back to herself/someone she knows. I'm fine with a 15 second interjection, but when it lasts 3 minutes about something I don't care about (e.g., her friend's son's girlfriend's parents who are antivaxxers), it really bothers me. I do redirect the conversation back to where I want it, but it's difficult and tiring to do that every other session.... and I shouldn't have to do that. If I were a therapist, I would never do this.

To be honest, I have definitely outgrown her and I'm planning on finding a new therapist within the year. I'm going through a big transition now, though, and her knowledge of my history is very helpful, so I do want to keep seeing her for a few more months at least.

I can get along with men but they always want something else from me in the end and then I feel awkward and in a position where I cant really be myself and have to watch what I say.

The thought of women absolutely petrifies me. I was not sexually abused by women as a kid, but I never had a mom. My mom was abusive.

I'm not petrified of women in the sense that they'll physically or mentally abuse me whatsoever, I'm terrified that they'll think I'm using them. I'm extremely scared to death that they'll hate me and judge me and be mad at me and think I'm weird or selfish or TOO depressing and a downer and that I make everything about me and my troubles and one day they'll just snap at me and complain that I'm not a good friend because all I ever talk about is myself, my trauma, how sad and needy and lonely I am, and say how much of a huge burden I am that it's like trying to take care of a baby etc. I'm scared of turning them into a mother figure. I think? I really dont know.

When I say petrified I truly truly mean scared to absolute death I literally feel like I'm going to curl up and cry and die.

lhc0zd,therapy,1613014819.0,"I was on track to get a job at a place I love and the only thing that was left was to formalize everything via a video interview. I had a choice between reading from a deck of cards to avoid going overboard or giving wrong answers... and trusting myself since I'd practiced everything for 6 weeks up until that point. I decided at the last minute the deck of cards would sound mechanical and unnatural so I tried to go natural... what a mistake.

It was a huge mistake. I overdid it by a long shot and said things that really didn't portray me in the best light. I almost ranted. I know it's because I have been alone for too long. The pandemic made my already bad mental health situation a lot worse. But that's not really an excuse for how badly I bombed this. I could tell they were reevaluating how good a fit I really was and who can blame them. I could see it on their faces.

I talked too much because I have barely spoken to any other human being in almost a year now, and before then I wasn't socializing because I was in therapy twice a week and couldn't handle talking to people at all.

Now... I talk to myself randomly during the day... I rant at the walls thinking of people from my past. (Yes... I know how bad this is. It's getting worse.)

I work from home. I bet if my neighbors could hear me they'd think I've gone batshit, because I have.

I know why I did this, why this is happening. I can't stop it though. Everything wrong with my life is in front of me, like cards strewn across a table, because I'd been in therapy for 2 years nonstop every week and it was too much stuff dug up all at once, when I have zero support to deal with it. I've never had support. Once the therapy appointment was over, I was all by myself.

I did this to myself... I thought I could handle it, I thought if I could just get through it things would get better. Well... I can't, and I have no one to help me, and it's frankly too late since I'm already gone off the deep end.

I have a really messed-up life, a horrible people picker, I got myself into bad situations because I didn't know any better... I wrack my brain trying to figure out where I could have done better and I'd have needed a lot of luck I didn't have. I really did what I could... but man, objectively I am an example of someone who should have been able to be so much better. Or maybe my circumstances were really that fucked up? But it takes ages to explain the whole thing. Am I not just making up fucking excuses? I understand why the people who fucked me up did so. But what does it matter?

I've seriously hurt people along the way as a result because I didn't get to have good role models as a kid and was constantly redirected back to my possessive mother when I tried to find inspiration elsewhere than my abusive parents. This left me around people who just abused me, I picked the same kind of people after I became an adult... I understand the process, the cycle of violence, attachment issues... But essentially I've been alone, unsupported for most of my life because I wasn't who my parents wanted me to be, then because I was critical I was a bully; I was bullied myself, quickly became too depressed to be appreciated as a teenager, I tried to do EVERYTHING by myself after that because I needed to be perfect to be loved and I was always alone anyway.... I supported people who didn't support me, I burnt out for jobs that didn't support me. I chose the worst boyfriends and tolerated all of their crappy, abusive, immature and weak behavior because I thought it was my job as a woman to do that.

Last few years everything came to a head and I finally noticed how alone I really have been for 40 years. Since I was a baby, I was a bother, I wasn't the perfect little child one parent wanted and I was despised for existing by the other.

I've never had anyone I could tell this whole picture to. That's pathetic in itself. The story is equally pathetic. I'm 40 years old and dead inside because I was never loved. I should have been able to just get over it, as if I'm the only one in this situation in the world, as if I somehow deserved a better outcome ""just because we should all be loved""... nah I'd have to basically let myself get exploited to be worth loving at this point. I just know it. I grew a spine, for what? To continue being alone. I got away from an abusive ex for what? It was a shit choice either way, stay with him and be alone around him, or be actually literally alone.

Realizing this, integrating it... It's absolutely devastating me. I have managed to hold it together at work for the last 2 years... until now.

I **had** a job. It was in the bag. I bombed it because I CANNOT LIVE AND KEEP BEING THIS ALONE. I just cried in the shower for half an hour because I have NEVER had anyone to give me even a fucking hug and offer some encouragement at an interview. What I got was always criticism or disinterest. I could have used a hug from someone who'd have loved me despite being a poor performer. I have never had that. I've loved people who really didn't love me, they loved all the crap I could do for them. It hurts. I never will have that. I'd have to bend over backwards in ways I know are just not healthy. Because I have nothing to offer but a broken person, and that's honey to fucking predators.

And because I've done the work and taken notice and finally came to terms with this... I am punished by it. I can't stuff all of this crap back inside anymore, it has to be dealt with.

IT COST ME MY EMPLOYMENT IN THE MIDDLE OF A PANDEMIC. Being told ""Sorry... after all we're going to go with the other strong candidate we got. I hope you understand."" Yeah, you bet I do. I wouldn't hire me after that if the roles were reversed.

And I'm still alone having to deal with the aftermath of this. Like usual. Going to cry myself to sleep *again* for another reason and having to figure out how to deal with a whole new set of people in a potentially abusive work environment....... hah there's a silver lining there. I'm used to THAT. I'll just go back to who I was when I was being abused! I'll ""survive"" that way. For sure. I'll just resign myself to being abused. That's where life always seems to shove me and I can't do a damn thing about it anymore.

I can't imagine ever having a relationship where I don't have to debase myself or be exploited to be liked. I am completely broken. Years of therapy to... learn how to live alone? I don't want that. I really don't. But that's all I can have. It's the only realistic outcome.

I can't deal with any of this anymore. I couldn't keep it together for a fucking interview. THE EXACT TIME I NEEDED TO KEEP IT TOGETHER MOST.

I don't think I can keep it together at all after this. I'm just going to let myself get fat, and uglier and uglier so I at least don't attract any assholes, or I can know the guys who go for me are full of problems and should be avoided anyway. I am so tired of being looked at like an object, or a resource, or a maid, or a cook, or a sexbot, or a therapist.

I'm too old for all of this. Too tired. I can't deal with the prospect of having to live alone, unloved for the rest of my life when my entire life before that I tried so hard to be loved only to be met by fucking predators everywhere.

I don't want to argue with a therapist over this. I don't want to be told I have to find silver linings. I don't want to be told i'm ""seeing everything wrong"" or that I'm ""too hard to work with"" or ""too argumentative"" or ""too opinionated"" or that I should try DBT or just ""have hope"" that some.... equally broken guy comes along and we make each other 2x as miserable? Or that I'm supposed to settle because I'm shit myself. 

I am tired of being criticized even if I did my best. MY BEST WAS NEVER GOOD ENOUGH, I GET IT, STOP SAYING IT.

I had just adopted a cat, too... It's breaking my heart right now that I'll have to rehome her soon. Poor little thing, she is just a cat, she doesn't deserve to be around a human who'll end up neglecting her because all I can do is get worse from this point on. She doesn't deserve to be abandoned but what's better... her getting new humans or getting a dead corpse to eat on the floor?

I really understand why my half-brother killed himself at 41, now. I was 25 when I found out. I wondered back then ""why so quick... why not give it more time, more years to get better?""... well I know why, now. It was probably just more years of him probably doing his best and it never panning out, and he had to deal with his rage and his own past all by himself, and it was too much.

Sometimes it just doesn't get better. We have a set number of chances in life and if we miss them all... what we're left with is hanging out with people who are much, much worse than us, and so we become like them.",https://www.reddit.com/r/therapy/comments/lhc0zd/i_bombed_an_interview_because_ive_been_alone_my/,I bombed an interview because I've been alone my entire life and recently realized this due to therapy that I don't want to continue.

I made my way to the spot I always sat in, but before I could make it I was struck by three words from a friend. Blank passed away. 

It didn't hit me immediately, in fact I don't think it really truly hit me when they pulled all of his friends into a conference room and had one of our substitute teachers, who was also a preacher, come and talk to us, followed by our band director.

I've been a little unsure about it because there do not appear to be any structure or goals, or discussion of appropriate modalities. I explained to the service that recommended her that I was looking for help processing a lot of trauma, but in the sessions she mostly just offers generic CBT type of advice. 

She is very quick to suggest that we terminate a session early if there is a lull in conversation or I mention that I happen to be tired that day. I do not take her up on that because I've paid for the full hour and it's not like she's going to refund me partial payment for that time. 

At our last session she said it seemed like we ran out of things to talk about and asked if I wanted to stop early. I mentioned that she asks this a lot and it makes me feel that she is pressed for time. She denied that was case, and said she simply wanted me to be able to use this time for something else if we weren't making any progress. I said that I didn't feel we were not making progress but felt concerned that she seems to feel that way if she is making the suggestion.

To give some additional information, I've never been in a relationship and have had extremely low self-esteem for nearly a decade. I have cyberstalked countless amounts of classmates and strangers in the past, ever since I was 12, but I'll just give one more recent example. In December of 2020 I came across this guy after reading an article about his sister who died in an accident ten years ago. He was really good-looking, had a great education, and seemed humorous and nice. He's in his early twenties and from the UK while I'm from the U.S.A. I didn't think too much about him but decided to Google him again in January. I found we shared some common interests and it ignited my interest in him further. I then began scouring the internet for any bit of information I could find of him. I know his dog's name, his major when he was in university, his A-level scores, his parent's names, where he was born, some of his favorite songs, the name of the shop he runs with his girlfriend (didn't know he had a girlfriend until like seven months into my stalking), the high school he went to and more. I'd spend a couple hours everyday just staring at his photos on Facebook and trying to find more tagged photos of him. I'd also find his high school friends and try to find their social media accounts so I could find some photos of him when he was younger. I was often very sad during this period of obsession with him because my whole self-esteem was based on the fact of whether he would approve of me or not and I could never know because I'd never meet him in real life, plus the fact that he has a girlfriend. I even tried to log into his email account by guessing his security questions. This stalking spanned between January to August, with varying degrees of intensity. In August when I went back to university, my obsession with him went away and I don't do this anymore. I'm very sure it'll happen again so I want to prevent it but I don't know what's wrong with me. I've heard OCD-related disorders can cause this but I obviously don't want to self-diagnose myself and I don't think you guys can diagnose me either, but I just want some insight. I want to do this for myself and for others too.

I started leaving the house more and social interaction didn‚Äôt bother me as much. So I ignored the red flags because I thought she was doing some good.

ocv4mq,therapy,1625306233.0,"Hi, I'm 22F and I've recently realised that what I went through as a child is affecting my feelings towards men in general. 

Long story short i've experienced child on child sexual abuse and sexual harrassment. I essentially developed early and that caused me to capture a lot of awful attention from boys and men which made me feel like crap. 

I was often groped or made fun of through my teen years by classmates. Even when I was on my way home from school, whether I was walking on the street or on public transport, strange men would often stare or whisper about at me. As for the abuse, I experienced it under the age of 10. It was done by a relative who was the same age as me. At the time, I didnt take in what was happening. How could I? I was a kid. And I thought we were just playing around. And when there were times when I didnt want to do anything, he would get annoyed. 

But all of these past traumas are affecting me now since I had gotten out of a relationship with someone who played with my emotions and was only interested in having sex. Thank goodness I didnt go through with it. But then he decided to cheat and leave me for someone else. It deeply hurt since he was at first a gentleman who genuinely liked and cared about me for a very long time, and was my very first boyfriend. Plus it was a breath of fresh air to be treated ""like a lady"" by a man for once. I'm over him now as the incident and break up was several months ago. But it left me reflecting on everything that I went through with men in general. I didn't feel anything while all those things were happening, but looking back now I feel ashamed, disrespected, hurt and angry. I honestly wonder if I can ever really trust men again.

mwsobp,therapy,1619175461.0,"TL;DR: Think I've connected some dots between early loss of my father and my mourning over my recent ex (whatever the relationship, whoever the ex). I feel this may have always been a mourning for the father I never knew.

&#x200B;

I recently ended therapy as I could no longer afford it. One day last week, I was at home and my partner \[33f\] was at work. I found myself mourning my last ex \[44m\] even though he was often unpleasant, had an alcohol problem and the relationship was unhealthy to saw the least. As I'm trying to understand myself more and how I got into and stayed in a relationship like that for 8 years, I was reflecting on some of the conversations with my therapist. I realised that I ALWAYS mourned my last ex, whatever stage in life and whatever relationship I've been in. I've had 4 other long-term relationships (with men and women, lasting from 8 months to 8 years) aside from my current fiance. In each of these relationships, I've had weird, illogical mourning for the previous partner, even though it was usually me who ended that relationship because it was unhealthy.

Here's the revelation and background...

My mum had me when she was a teenager, she was on and off with my dad and he was killed in a road accident when I was 12 months old. My mum doesn't like to talk about my dad as it still upsets her. My dads parents are still alive and well and I have a good relationship with them but both them and me get emotional if the topic of my dad comes up in conversation. I never knew my dad so never grieved as such.

I went to psychotherapy a few years ago when I experienced a bout of low mood and suicidal thoughts, these were particularly strong when I was regularly driving home from work. I'd also had panic attacks following my annual review at work and a tooth extraction. My psychotherapist noted 'loss' as the common thread in the panic attacks (loss of a tooth, potential loss of my job). When asked the circumstances around my dads death, I told him that he was killed on his way home from work. I was very sceptical of his insights but he suggested the mental health was a result of grieving the loss of my dad.

So the mourning over the exes....

I came to the realisation that I'm all too familiar with mourning what could have been, the relationship with a person lost and this is something I've done all my life. I don't think I'm ever really wanting the ex back (whichever ex is it at any point in time) I think I'm mourning the loss of my dad.

I think I just wanted to share that with the world.

I feel lighter for understanding this.

I think that going forward I'm going to find ways to honour my dad and his life and manage my grieving of him.

qezdjr,therapy,1635104133.0,"I really don‚Äôt know how to proceed. I spontaneously took my girlfriend on a trip and took her to her first ever concert to see her favorite childhood band. She didn‚Äôt know what I was planning until we got to the arena and I took her to buy a shirt of the group. As we watched the group play from the VIP section, I noticed I was the only person showing affection. It started as us holding hands to nothing. She apparently saw a girl put her hand on my hand (which did not happen) and gave me the cold shoulder the rest of the concert. Earlier in the day she accused me of only buying a water because I wanted to talk to the girl. *sigh* Anyways, I promised her it didn‚Äôt happen and told her to chose her fights wisely, because this night/event wasn‚Äôt it. She started to try and make small talk and as we left we stopped to buy a few souvenirs. The no affection continued. I grab her hand and felt how dead it was, so I gave up. We sat separated the taxi ride to the hotel. When we got to the hotel, I exploded as she just went to sleep. I woke her up and told her I couldn‚Äôt believe how ungrateful she was and she told me that I showed her no affection and that I didn‚Äôt even try.

I know you shouldn‚Äôt expect gratitude for your good deeds, but it REALLY hurt to create this experience for her and feel this way.

She has been diagnosed with cluster B BPD always feels like a roller coaster. 

This morning no apology with her large ego and pride. We walked separately to get breakfast and at some points on opposite sides of the street.  

She told me that after last night the relationship is over in her eyes. I am so shocked that you can treat someone with such good intentions this way.

pigvgd,therapy,1630861448.0,"I'm an associate therapist mid-way through the hours I need to accrue before I can sit for the licensure exam.  A few months ago I decided to get therapy to deal with depression, anxiety and isolation that skyrocketed during the pandemic.  Much to my surprise, I absolutely love this therapist.  We dove right in to the deep stuff, and I am taking mental notes about the way she holds space for me so that someday I can do that for my clients (assuming I get to licensure). 

Here's the weird thing:  there was no ""intake"" like the one that my agency uses, where information is gathered about jobs, support systems, past therapeutic experiences, etc.  Because of that, I never took the opportunity to tell her that I'm a therapist.  And to be honest, it's been a bit of a relief, because with my mental state the way it is, I sometimes wonder if I should even be seeing clients right now.   As time goes on and more and more unravels, the less I want to tell her that I am doing this type of work.  Yes, I know she will not judge me....but she will probably open a dialogue about it and what it all means to me, and I'd rather focus on other things that feel more important.

Another weird thing:  this therapist doesn't have my address, birthday, emergency contact or even know how to spell my last name.  I pay cash via Venmo, and we meet virtually using FaceTime.  What really stands out for me is that there was NO informed consent or discussion about limits to confidentiality.  She does not have one piece of paper with my signature on it.  She said she will speak with my psychiatrist, but didn't ask for a signed release.  All of these things were drilled into me so hard during my training that I started to wonder if she has a side gig as a life coach and I somehow slid into that category.  I checked with the state licensing board out of curiosity and her license is valid, although they did publish that she was pretty heavily fined about a year ago for an administrative offense (not criminal).  This is driving me crazy, and I am not sure what to do.  She is hands-down the best therapist I have ever worked with and has given me new hope for the profession.  Can anyone share their thoughts?

fgmwkh,therapy,1583881101.0,"Let me preface this by stating that I am far from being a model client, patient or whatever term you choose to use. 

I‚Äôve engaged with Reddit a couple years and in this sub for approximately six months. While I understand that this community is full of individuals, there sometimes seems to be us against them mentality. 

By this I mean that when some post about their session and there was differing opinions on how a therapist/counselor/psychologist/psychiatrist should have reacted or what they should‚Äôve said, for someone like me, relatively new to the sub, it‚Äôs kind of, I don‚Äôt even know what word I want to use to describe it. 

F‚ÄîK him/her (therapist)! What the 
f‚Äîk does he/she (counselor) know! Eff that! Find someone else that cares about you! 

Granted, like every profession, there are those that are exceptional, great, good, fair and poor at their job. And not everyone gels with someone; this isn‚Äôt unique to the alliance between therapists and their clients. But are these reasons to go on the attack? 

Firstly, when I read a post or comment I‚Äôm only getting one side of the story and it may be perceived at that. 

Secondly, I can only comment as to how I can relate based on my experience(s); and, even then I can‚Äôt account for what, when, why or how my therapist said what he/she did for me to react a certain way. Therapy isn‚Äôt an exact science, it‚Äôs dealing with human behavior and while that behavior can be somewhat predictable based on certain variables, it‚Äôs a crapshoot as to what happens. 

I‚Äôm a difficult client in more ways than one. There are days when I think if I was a therapist and every client was like me, I‚Äôd start drinking because, it‚Äôs 5 o‚Äôclock somewhere! There are other days when everything fell into place I think they‚Äôd be content if every client was like me. But, that‚Äôs how it goes when interacting with humans.

So, like I wrote in my title, upvote, downvote, comment or skip over, I don‚Äôt care. Of course I care! Not caring what others think is a goal of mine. 

Anyway, I wanted  to share my thoughts. Notice I didn‚Äôt write that I ‚Äúhad‚Äù to; another goal of mine.

sip9zb,therapy,1643810057.0,"That‚Äôs not just me being fed up with therapy btw (although I am), but I‚Äôm genuinely wanting to know, how is therapy supposed to help?

I‚Äôve been in therapy for almost 3 years now and after swapping a couple times to get one who seemed decent, it‚Äôs just been a long string of try method after method only to report back after 3-6 months that I still feel as shitty as I ever have. Hell, my mental state has actually severely worsened over the course of those 3 years. I have virtually zero faith in it anymore because it‚Äôs just been so useless for me, but I guess I still go because it does apparently work for some people and I don‚Äôt know what else to try because medication has no effect on me either.

So I guess I‚Äôm trying to find out from someone it has helped, how? How did it help you? What were the actual steps you took? And how did those steps actually have an effect? What part of it had value to you?

I‚Äôm just at a loss because it kinda just feels like I go in, talk about stuff I don‚Äôt really wanna talk about, hear some theories about why I feel certain ways about certain things (most of which I‚Äôm already aware of). And maybe the nature of the words change depending on what method is being used, but it‚Äôs all just words at the end of the day. Like when I did schema therapy, as an example. I went in there and one of the things I was supposed to ‚Äúchallenge‚Äù was my belief that people are shit and I can‚Äôt handle being around them. And I‚Äôm already aware that obviously not all people are shitty, but the proportion is high enough that the potential negatives far outweigh the limited positives. There‚Äôs no words that can convince me I‚Äôd rather not deal with the consequences that come with people, good or bad. So it‚Äôs just useless words.

And if there is actions involved, it feels like it‚Äôs always stuff that has really limited use to me. Like mindfulness, for instance. Like, great I‚Äôm not my thoughts or whatever and I can just observe them, but that doesn‚Äôt really help me at all. What am I realistically supposed to do with that, just borderline dissociate whenever I‚Äôve gotta deal with people cause my thoughts are gonna be hating it and convincing me not to do it? Like my body and mind don‚Äôt feel good when I have to do that, and that doesn‚Äôt feel like it solves the problem so much as it pushes it down. Maybe if I absolutely have to deal with someone for some reason I can do that to get through it, but it doesn‚Äôt fix anything.

I‚Äôm just really frustrated cause none of this stuff seems to address any of the larger issues in a way that actually makes me feel any better. I just want to understand what it actually is that I‚Äôm supposed to be getting here so I can understand why none of it works.",https://www.reddit.com/r/therapy/comments/sip9zb/how_is_therapy_actually_supposed_to_help/,How is therapy actually supposed to help?,,74,57,0.96

The first time we met, it was casual and fun until we decided to take a walk in a park nearby. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going on in your life‚Äù he would ask me every single time we met, and proceeded with how messed up his life is and how therapy has helped him become a better person. He comes from a rich background and was lamenting about all the family feuds he has to face on a daily basis, and then asked me if there‚Äôs any messed up things happening in my life. Being new to the friendship, I was not comfortable with sharing and so did not mention anything in particular but he continued to probe.

He said he saw potential in me, that I could be a lot happier if I were truthful to my feelings.

mcmeht,therapy,1616635567.0,"Alright this is a small problem in the grander scheme of things and I'm really just looking to talk it out. I don't know how you guys are but a lot of other Reddit groups have this thing where they automatically tell you to break up with your SO so I want to get ahead of that and say I'm happily married and have no plans to get divorced. I appreciate that that's where you might go to in trying to help but it's not in the cards.

I've been feeling a lot like a bad husband recently. My wife and I only recently bad dual income after a long period of only me working and I'm so proud of her for getting a new job and making our home a lot more stable. I myself also recently changed careers and have been trying to give myself props for getting a new position too.

But she plans everything and I'm aware of that. We're two very different kinds of people and I can be a little scatter brained without someone giving me direction. She was the one who cane to me to suggest getting cash back cards to help with our money. She's the one who stays up late into the night worrying about how we're ever going to afford a house. She went to the DMV to transfer her plates when we changed states and got it. I went and realized I'd forgotten a form. This happened twice.

If a type A personality involves trying to get ahead of every small detail before it becomes a problem, then she's that. To the point where it can actually be a little self harming. She'll sometimes come to me a half hour before bed and ask me why I don't have more of a plan for our retirement, which is fair. But then the expectation is that I'll stay up into the early hours of the morning hashing it out with her, always when I have work in the morning and, usually, when she doesn't. She worries constantly about the future and i, like a lot of people I think, feel overwhelmed by it, just trying to put money into our rainy day fund (which she hasn't done because she has student loans to pay) and waiting for answers. I try to take care of things on a day-to-day basis, paying the bills (50/50 but I handle the transactions), making calls to banks, customer support, things I know she hates and doesn't feel like she should do all of. I'm also matching her payments on her student loan so we can halve the time on this thing. And (this will factor into the story) I'm also not from the states: I emigrated from South Africa to marry her three years ago and I've handled most of the paperwork and dealt with being away from family etc. I wanted to do it so this isn't a sob story, I'm just setting the stage for what happened today.

I know that all of this still makes for a prettyone-sided relationship. She's got all of the big picture stuff CONSTANTLY on her mind and I need to be more present. So I've been trying to handle more on my own. Recently she came to me and said she wants to take a trip later this year. She found an air B&B she likes and we looked at airline tickets, finding good deals on both. My side, today, was to go to work and lock down the PTO for any weekend in September. There were a couple of open slots at the Air B&B and she only works one weekend in Sept so we decided we would just confirm on my side and then get it any weekend that isn't the one she works.

I did both of those things this morning without any problems. She sleeps during the day (night shift nurse) so she said to book the Air B&B ASAP once I found out so it doesn't close on us (this place gets a lot of bookings). Using all of this information, I got on and made the booking. after work, I came home and we sat together and booked the airline tickets as well. She was going in for a shift tonight, so we want to get it all done, and we did.

About 20 minutes before she was supposed to leave, my wife made a big realization. We are going to be away on the weekend of Labor Day. Which should be fine, because she know she‚Äôs only on the schedule for the following weekend. But here‚Äôs the catch: they haven‚Äôt made the weekday schedules going out that far. When it comes to Monday to Friday, she only knows the shift she‚Äôs working for the next month and a half.

Cue a frantic conversation where she doesn‚Äôt know if the woman who does the scheduling is going to be OK with her not being there on Labor Day. And, I must stress again, this is all information that she didn‚Äôt know, and I didn‚Äôt know. But our freakout quickly turned into a conversation about how I should‚Äôve been more present and aware of the fact that it‚Äôs Labor Day, and she‚Äôs a nurse, and that that would potentially be a problem. She left in a huff, and I felt like everything I did sort of counted for nothing, because now she‚Äôs at work stressing out over the fact that she‚Äôs had to check with her manager about Labor Day and we won‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs a go until she gets back to her. As I mentioned earlier in my post, I‚Äôm not actually from this country, but I have lived here for a few years and I suppose I should‚Äôve been quicker to pick up on that. Once again, her worry and obsessive attention to detail was what brought this to our attention, and she's tired of always having to be the person to catch this kind of stuff. 

I know that mental load is a real problem between men and women in very similar situations to us, and I guess I‚Äôm making this post partially out of frustration at myself, partially wondering if I was as at fault as she made it out to be, and how I‚Äôm gonna break out of this rut.

M got the the point where he‚Äôd show up a lot to the house and well around the age of 8 I wanna say it‚Äôs kinda of a blur when it all started but he just started touching me outta of the blue one time thru my pants, I guess he was curious but I was just shocked mainly bc no one ever touched me like that so I was more or less confused than he started to touch me more often walk around the apartment and show me his ass, I remember an exact moment where he was dry humping me and my sister just watched him do it we were all in the same room to this day that still scars me, I don‚Äôt think she has any recollection of it definitely does not take accountability for it.

k7pxcu,therapy,1607242734.0,"Hello, to all you lovely people. I‚Äôm hoping someone can help me with this.

This happened to me earlier this year and I still think about this therapist from time to time. I started EMDR and mindfulness/somatic based therapies with her for my ptsd and traumas. I really liked our progress and the direction of the sessions. I could see myself with her long term. I attended a few sessions with her, maybe about 5 or 6. She informed me she was going on a trip. I believe it was about a week or week and a half at most (like 10 days). I remember squeezing an appointment right before her travels. When I arrived for the session before her trip, her door was shut. I found it strange as she always leaves her door open prior to our session. I decided to wait it out as I drove far from home to see her. I texted her but she didn‚Äôt reply. I called her two different business numbers with no response. I left two voicemails. I wasn‚Äôt upset or angry. I tried to be as respectful as possible when I left the voicemails wondering where she was or if she forgot the session. I triple checked to make sure I had the right day and time.
I did. I waited 15-30 minutes past our scheduled time, but she never showed up.
I checked her door one more time and turned the knob this time and it was locked. 

I tried calling her several times after that, closer to when her trip ended but it would go straight to voicemail. I thought I was being ghosted at that time. I decided to give it two weeks before calling some more and reaching out via email. I received no responses. 
Her profile is no longer on psychology today or other sites and her website no longer exists. I try to look her up but can‚Äôt find any information and it shouldn‚Äôt be difficult as she has an extremely rare and unique name!! It‚Äôs so weird to me and every once in a while she crosses my mind and I hope that she is well, alive, and eventually did make it safely back from her trip. 

I guess by this post I‚Äôm wondering if there is any way at all to verify that she is okay? When I was looking for new therapists, I briefly mentioned this to one. This alarmed them and they asked for her name so they could check within groups and agencies to make sure she was ok but they never got back to me.",https://www.reddit.com/r/therapy/comments/k7pxcu/therapist_went_mia_and_i_still_think_about_this/,Therapist went MIA and I still think about this.

tniktb,therapy,1648202590.0,"I didn‚Äôt actually know who I should take this to but I‚Äôd hope this counts as something appropriate to this group. 

Recently I took a 23&me dna test to learn about my own heritage, what I found actually surprised me. 

I already knew some of my families history, my moms side of the family was Scottish and French. 

Dad is Ashkenazi (Jewish people who settled in central and Eastern Europe during the Middle Ages.) And Norwegian on his dads side. 

What I learned from 23&me is that my grandmother on my moms side of the family are actually from the Caribbeans, and came from the Virgin Islands üáªüá¨ 

However, 23&me traced her ancestry back further to Barbados üáßüáß in a town called saint Michael. Where her African ancestors would intermingle with her British ancestors between the mid 1750‚Äôs up to the American civil war. 

Their footprints go all the way back to Nigeria üá≥üá¨ where they were scattered all across the west African coast, and in places like Ghanaian, Liberian &
Sierra Leonean. 

Beyond that point is unknown, as it says they were Broadly Sub-Saharan African which means that before my African ancestors came to the west African coast the came from almost anywhere on  the African content. 

I realized immediately what this ultimately meant, that mine, my mother and grandmothers family were the descendants of African slaves as well as the slave owners who abused them. 

At first I was shocked and horrified by the knowledge of this, my family has always been sort of closeted racists behind closed doors. 

My own mother told me when I was a child that she never wanted to see me dating someone African American (course she didn‚Äôt phrase it like that) otherwise I‚Äôd give my grandparents a heart attack and surly disappoint her and the rest of the family. 

I was actually outraged by this and I couldn‚Äôt understand why something like that would ever matter, at the time all I could think to do was just argue ‚ÄúI have the right to love whoever I want, it‚Äôs my life, I don‚Äôt care about skin color or race. 

It was all true but my mom just got passive aggressive with me and brushed it off as teen anxt. 

Suddenly it felt as though it all made sense though, all the racism behind my family and I realized I always knew better then they did about this. 

You realize the unfortunate reality that most people with African ancestry likely had an ancestor who was a slave and to have had four fathers who took part in the slave trade is a terrible thing to learn‚Ä¶it‚Äôs horrible. 

Their is no justification for turning a human being into a piece of property or subjugating them to torturing and stripping them of their own culture ripping them away from their homes and families.  

I always knew this and it all circled in my head just spinning, and I had a realization. 

The best possible thing I could do with this information is to just celebrate my African ancestry, to do right where the rest of my family didn‚Äôt. 

They likely knew about all of this and kept it buried not really telling anyone even their own children otherwise I‚Äôd have remembered a conversation about the family being related or descended of slave owners. 

So the most I can do, is to honor my African roots be proud of it like I would the rest of my heritage. All cultures are something to be celebrated, and by being woke to the subject I‚Äôm being better then my own family was about this. 

It doesn‚Äôt change who I am but it‚Äôs given me a new culture I didn‚Äôt even know I had to celebrate. 

And I‚Äôm proud to be of African decent like I am to be of Jewish decent and all the other places my ancestors walk around the world because humanity is one big family and we‚Äôre all each other‚Äôs brothers and sisters no matter who you are or where you come from or what you look like, we‚Äôre all human and we should all learn to honor and respect one and other. 

And that‚Äôs what I‚Äôd like to learn from this instead of denying it, I won‚Äôt make the mistakes my family made.",https://www.reddit.com/r/therapy/comments/tniktb/i_took_a_23_me_test_and_discovered_i_have_african/,I took a 23 & me test and discovered I have African ancestry.,,75,35,0.89

His grades are mediocre at best, he's in no clubs, has no job, just goes to class and comes home to watch youtube and play video games all day. He doesn't know how to cook, so I end up cooking (I don't even really cook, I follow recipes I find on Pinterest). I get very little personal time. Mom set up a chore chart for him at the start of last semester, but he doesn't follow it. That means I end up either 1) doing his cleaning myself or 2) asking him to pitch in and dealing with the ensuing temper tantrum.

I was out and about with my parents today. They stayed in the car while I went and bought bubble tea. When I came back, my parents were talking about my brother. Then *I* got lectured.

The reason why I was lectured? I'm doing *so* well at life that apparently it puts pressure on my younger brothers. Apparently, things look so easy for me that my brothers think things should come *naturally* to them and stop when they don't.

Never mind the fact I've been in therapy since I was 12. Never mind the fact I take damn near an entire pharmacy worth of medication just to stay out of the psych ward. Never mind the fact I have to work twice as hard as all my peers because of my ADHD. Never mind the fact I have had major surgery after major surgery to correct chronic pain that left me bedbound in high school. Never mind the fact I'm getting autism testing because I have been struggling in school as things have gone back to IRL classes and social situations. Never mind the fact I order groceries b/c I get overstimulated from grocery stores and it's a matter of groceries taking a couple hours vs the entire day. No, I have things *so* easy that it puts pressure on my brothers to do well.

I feel like my parents are pulling that out of their asses to explain why my brother is struggling instead of him getting in trouble for poor grades or bombing interviews. Like, last semester, he got a C in a class and they were like ""Oh it's okay! You're still young you're learning just ask your older brother for help!"" I got a 97% in a class and my dad asked me why I didn't get 100% and where that extra 3% went.

qzrhna,therapy,1637604106.0,"Hi. This post is going to be long and TW (Su!c!de and R@pe will discussed) so I‚Äôm F22 and I haven‚Äôt lived with my mother (F42) Since I was 19. When I lived with her, it was absolutely horrible. I have five brothers and I‚Äôm the only girl and I lived basically as a prisoner most of my life. 

She would tell them to call me a checker burger when I smelled bad. One day when i was 15 she decided to make me strip almost completely naked so she could whoop me, and when I kept moving, she told my brothers to hold me down, while I was half naked. So i said I hated them and she beat me up, ripped up my shirt and pants, and dragged me outside by my hair and made my brothers keep me locked out on the porch basically naked for hours. Then when she got home at night. She‚Äôd called the police and told them she didn‚Äôt want me living there anymore. They didn‚Äôt take me.

I‚Äôm a dark skinned black girl, so school growing up wasn‚Äôt always welcoming. Especially in elementary and middle school because I would get bullied about being ‚Äúso dark, you could turn off the lights and I‚Äôd disappear‚Äù (my skin tone is a few shades darker than brown, I‚Äôm not THAT dark) and because I have scars on my feet from my mom according to her: Leaving me in the tub alone when I was 2. Causing me to turn on the water and give myself 3rd degree burns. I didn‚Äôt know that was something a child could do but whatever. 

When I was 15, I was bullied in school for wearing something ‚Äúweird‚Äù and when I came home, I was degraded by her too. Afterwards, I left her room and heard her tell my aunt ‚ÄúI hate her‚Äù, I turned around and asked her if she meant it and SHE LOOKED ME DEAD IN MY EYES AND SAID YES. When I admitted that I‚Äôd tried to k!ll myself when I was 12, she called my dad and told him it was HIS fault. That night I took an entire bottle of iron pills. 

Over the years, I‚Äôve learned to try not to expect better from my mother. But I had a baby last November and his birthday was last week. All of a sudden I got super sad and I was taken back to my childhood. I‚Äôd gotten so sad, I { TW active: sliced at myself while in the bathtub} it didn‚Äôt work but afterwards, I made a 23 minute long video talking about my mental health and how the people that were supposed to protect me, didn‚Äôt. 

What do I mean by that? It couldn‚Äôt have been THAT bad right? Not exactly. When I was 18, I was touched on by my grandma‚Äôs husband. The man I‚Äôd known as my grandfather my entire life. I told my grandma a few months into the situation and begged her not to tell my mom because she would blame me. 

Well a year later, I found out that my mom knew the entire time. She said ‚Äúit‚Äôs not that bad cause she‚Äôs an adult and if it happened, why did I wait so long to say anything‚Äù, that coupled with my mom the week before asking me if I slept with her ex because he‚Äôd told her I did (they were on the middle of a legal battle because he‚Äôd stolen $4,000 from her) 

I stupidly felt like asking me that was offensive because I‚ÄôM HER DAUGHTER AND HE‚ÄôS THE EX THAT STOLE FROM HER. she felt differently. So I moved out. A few years later, {I told her that when I was 4, my cousins molested me and since I was 12, my eldest brother was r@ping me until 14} she didn‚Äôt say anything. 

Well, two days before my sons birthday this year, I decided to air it all out.I didn‚Äôt mention any names because I didn‚Äôt want anyone to be judged, I just wanted to breath for the first time in a long time, so I can be here for my son. 

The responses came quickly with people offering kind words and help but my mom didn‚Äôt respond. To be fair, a week before my mental breakdown, her ex and my brothers dad died. I felt shitty and I messaged her but she didn‚Äôt want to talk. I couldn‚Äôt tell my depression to stop because she was going through something, I was too. 

Well apparently that made me a shitty person. She didn‚Äôt contact me, it‚Äôs been a week and a half and I found out last night that she DID respond, just on her own page. She posted about how she won‚Äôt let ‚Äúsomeone‚Äù degrade her character because she knows she‚Äôs a good person and that she‚Äôs more loved than hated (I dont hate my mother, I‚Äôm sad that she hated ME when all I‚Äôve ever asked from her was to start over and have a normal relationship) she said she‚Äôs just going to smile and burn that bridge so‚Ä¶ I guess I‚Äôm a horrible daughter. 

After reading it, I was back to my worse state of mind and in my sadness, I took two months worth of birth control pills. Obviously it didn‚Äôt do anything but I wanted it to. How can she hate me so much? I dont know. My grandma said that I should‚Äôve talked to her instead of posting on FB. Am I the asshole?

I tried therapy a 4 years ago to help with dating (had only ever kissed a girl once before), but the therapist became abusive very fast and started pretending to misinterpret me to start fights, it descended into him attacking me and him often sitting back smugly squinting his eyes looking me at as if I was chicken shit and explicitly saying as much. Took me a few months to realise this wasn't ""toughening me up"" as I thought it might. In fact, my life fell apart and pretty much within weeks of leaving him suddenly went back to normal. I still ended up with a lot of internal conflict, especially as he started ""telling"" me what I was thinking and in one case even tried pretending to mishear what I'd said to suit his argument (I don't know if there is a phrase to describe this, but a sibling does the exact same thing when she doesn't get her way). Getting basic facts about me and my family wrong + trying to force inaccurate opinions about my thoughts down my throat was the limit for me.

In the few years since, I became an incel and only recently changed my views. For instance I'm beginning to realise that women don't have it as easy as I thought dating (in fact have a harder time, especially on dating apps). What's helped are a few things - accidentally getting a mild amount of success with women pre-lockdown and a friend giving tips, but lockdown has made me reflect on how I still have issues around social anxiety.

I let the friend from a social anxiety website (who gave some dating tips) know about my experiences with therapy, aswell as issues with my family - very much a ""sex doesn't exist"" household and where my mom still to this day plays mean jokes saying I'm ""not allowed to date"" as if jokingly when I know full well she'll bite my head off saying ""it's just a joke"" as if I'm the problem, not her - honestly feels like I had 2 loaded guns to my head whenever this gets brought up, whereas in my teens ""reliably informed"" anyone around me that I was ""not into girls yet"" long after my first crush (a crush she noticed). The therapist I had just couldn't wrap his head around it and seemed to silently decide half of it was made up and took the easy way out by misinterpreting it as me thinking not having a gf as a teen was an issue (I don't have an issue with that, I have an issue with still being stuffed with this problem long into my adulthood plus with tons of issues with my confidence), just so he could start fighting me. It felt like when schoolyard bullies would misinterpret people to start a verbal fight, even with a look of pretend confusion on his face. It seemed like he got what I was saying them BAM! in one session started getting shirty with me, ""forgetting"" details I'd given him, as if on purpose.

Possibly my intensity about wanting to date was getting in my way and I've changed that, but I still feel that the therapist wronged me somehow and I'm fearful of getting another asshole like him, only will try debating with me whether or not I'm still incel, toying with my emotions. I know what I'm thinking and I ain't incel anymore.

My friend keeps trying to pressure me into confrontation with my family, but I can just feel it in my bones that it won't change a thing, also he has suggested other therapists would be kinder and more willing to work with me, even if my goal was to date - my goal in therapy would be to improve myself inside so that whether or not I'm dating, it isn't so hard for me to get a date or form relationships with women.

Also he did suggest based on his experiences of therapy that the more I spend (I'm pretty well off atm) the better service I get (the therapist was very cheap) and that, even though lockdown gets in the way of dating, working on myself inside is possible and that I shouldn't be focusing so much on asking women out/bravery etc.

Was wondering what people here thought - is there a way of ensuring I select a therapist that doesn't mess me around? I asked my friend about CBT but he said it won't have the same lasting effect as psychodynamic, but he never did CBT. Plus what about sex therapy?

It was roughly a year and a half. It seemed calm, we slept and woke up together. Played video games and watched shit together but god forbid she got ‚Äútriggered‚Äù she‚Äôd turn into a fucking child, crying and making me feel like ive made a mistake.

This is the second time I broke up with her. Day by day I knew that coming back was a mistake but I loved her too much to realize. Even when I left for the first time, she started talking with other dudes and I got jealous, so I started thinking about my decision. I got very depressed and started to miss her so very much. Not to mention the unbearable guilt I felt, I felt like a monster and I felt like I deserved to go to hell because of breaking up. She even uploaded a video of her crying which made me feel even more miserable.

Today, during the second breakup. She kept talking about how she had to deal with my shit, which was basically just anger and frustration (I wonder why). When I told her that I‚Äôm done she said ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt handle the truth can‚Äôt you‚Äù or some shit. I was trying to be as stoic as possible during the entire thing, so I snapped and said ‚Äúthere‚Äôs a reason I keep running away from you‚Äù then she said ‚Äústop saying that, stop hurting me more you‚Äôve hurt me enough‚Äù then I blocked her.

Tbh I‚Äôm scared, I feel free and scared. The first time I broke up, things were horrible. I cried daily, every day and every night. I hope the same thing doesn‚Äôt happen now.

A few days later he was arrested for the rape of a third boy. He's in a jail, he's been charged, but he hasnt been convicted. I'm hoping it's wrong, that these boys have a grudge or are misremembering or whatever. But the more and more I *really* think about it, I know that's not the case. It's not looking good.

I'm really struggling to reconcile these two versions of the same person. How can the man that I've always viewed as good and kind and funny also be a predator who preys on children who trust him?

My family is devastated, his mother and grandma (basically raised him) are living in a nightmare. Has anyone else gone through something like this?

What I need help with is processing the feelings that arise from being far below average in physical attractiveness and getting over the impact that that has on my self-esteem. Unfortunately, he just won't hear of it, nor would the previous two therapists I've seen.

The line they have all taken so far is to deny it by equivocation (trying to use the subjectivity of beauty to paper over the fact that people generally agree on my looks) and trying to limit the definition of the ugliness with which they would be comfortable helping to extreme medical or injury-induced differences in appearance. The present one is the first to think of just saying ""I don't believe it"". Incidentally, none of them have suggested that BDD is likely, and I would agree, since, even if my ugliness were a delusion, I really don't fit the symptoms.

I find this makes how I feel about it even worse (especially since the idea that I'm just mistaken is really tempting and leads me easily into wishful thinking) as I can't really come to terms with something that's considered so terrible that it can't even be acknowledged - I'd love to be able to just openly accept it, like any other flaw, but I'm floored that it's this badly stigmatised.

fyfytl,therapy,1586525848.0,"Hi everyone. I have a very strange situation where I think I might have been kidnapped. My therapist opened my eyes to it in a session last week. 
Basically, I was born and raised in South America. Both of my parents are deadbeats who don't really care about me. my father left when I was 2, and my mother was 20 when she had me, no intention of being a single mother, and every intention to go live her best life anyway. I was left most of the time with my aunt or grandfather, whom I love with every part of my being. Whenever my mother was being terrible and abusive, I at least had them. They raised me, cared about me, and my aunt's 5 kids considered me one of their own. I had a safe haven with them. When I was 5, my mom got an American boyfriend. When I was 8, they got married, and out of the blue, from one day to the next, they took me to the US with them. I was extremely unhappy, cut off from the only people that loved me and cared about me and my well being. My mother and her husband were extremely abusive to me my whole life, still are. 
We have very rarely gone back to my original country, and my aunt and grandfather do not forgive my mother for taking me away. My whole life I considered this huge trauma ""just a move to another country"". 
My therapist brought in this insight, however: I was taken from the only people that saw after my wellbeing, and loved me, against their consent, and against my own consent very suddenly. I was taken into an abusive environment where I was isolated, didn't know anyone, didn't speak the language, and had no safe haven to escape the abuse I lived at home. Under many theories (and definitely under practice), she says I was kidnapped. Not in the usual form, but still in the textual form. And she says that the reason why I stay in that same abusive environment and can't move away, or can't talk badly about my mother even if she's extremely abusive and toxic is because I now live with Stockholm syndrome.
This is absolutely mind-blowing for me and I would love some other insights.

They said that was perfectly reasonable, if anything like that happened, they‚Äôd definitely assist me with keeping my boundaries. They said they would call me back last night for a consult and they didn‚Äôt.

Between these events, I tried calling phone lines for support, and left messages explaining the events at the peer respite. They are all supposed to call you back. None did.

No one cares. My ‚Äúfriends‚Äù came to my house to scream at me for choosing the ‚Äúwrong‚Äù mental health care for even going to the respite.

When I was around 9-10 years old I had a good male friend who was a bit older than me (like 11-12). Our parents were very close and we even went together on holiday. His father always seemed a bit strange to me and looking back he and his son are some sort of psychopaths. The dad regularly hit his wife and the son told in court that his mom would abuse him. Very weird family, to say the least. 
Anyway, I was just a little girl and didn‚Äôt know anything about sex or consent. I didn‚Äôt know what was going on and I never said yes or no. He was older and cooler than me and I wanted to be his friend, so I just let him do, what he needed to do. I never enjoyed it. One time he even asked me, if I had ever gotten my period and I didn‚Äôt even know what that was, so I said no. Looking back now, he was scared to get me pregnant. 
It happened on multiple occasions and I could‚Äôve said no, but I didn‚Äôt. Because 1) I didn‚Äôt know what was going on and 2) he pressured me into it and into not telling anyone.

l9dkdx,therapy,1612104128.0,"So, talking with my therapist, I seem to realise that I‚Äôm a hedonist? As in gaining pleasure/happiness and avoiding pain is the only intrinsic good. This seems obvious to me, and I assumed everyone would agree.

But she told me to read up on this ‚ÄúExperience Machine‚Äù thought experiment and that would refute my beliefs. To recap, that‚Äôs this:

The Experience Machine: Scientists have invented a virtual reality machine, sort of like The Matrix, where you can plug in and have completely happy experiences. When you are in the experience machine, you do not know that you are in the machine. They erase your memory of having plugged in, and the computer- simulation is so real, you cannot tell it apart from reality. You cannot leave the machine once you are inside, but the scientists guarantee that life INSIDE of the machine will be filled with far more happiness than your real life OUTSIDE of the machine. They give you a choice: Do you (1) Plug into the machine for the rest of your life, or (2) Choose not to plug in, though you know you will be less happy? Note that if you have obligations to other people in the real world, they will plug in too, if you do. No need to worry about them. They will be maximally happy.

The claim is that ‚Äúmost people‚Äù would not choose to be plugged in, and tada! Hedonism refuted! 

But the thing is, that I would, in a heartbeat and without a moments hesitation, choose to be plugged in. I cannot think of any greater gift to give someone. And it seems crazy to me that people would *refuse* it. So I‚Äôm clearly not ‚Äúmost people‚Äù, but I don‚Äôt see the downsides of it at all. Like it seems that ‚Äúyeah, but it‚Äôs not *real*‚Äù seems like a stupid objection. We experience the world as a bunch of noisy sensory signals that the brain smooths over and fills in the gaps before it hits your consciousness, so switch out the shitty inputs for maximally happy inputs, and at the level of ‚Äúyou‚Äù, it‚Äôs just as real. 

Anyway, why would people obviously object to this (so much that this claim is used to criticise all of hedonism with little further rationalisation, as far as I can tell).

After Halloween, we headed back home then to discover we have rats in the house.

oa69sg,therapy,1624965733.0,"\*Apologies if this isn't the right place to post\*

I just had a very difficult conversation with my therapist the other day; essentially, I felt like recently our sessions had left me feeling down, discouraged... nothing like they used to.

Long story short, when I first began seeing her almost 4 years ago, it was like I'd won the lottery. I'd tried speaking with other counselors/therapists many times in the past, but time after time, it just wasn't the right fit. I didn't understand when others would talk about how they ""really needed to talk to their therapist"" or how much better they felt after getting this or that off their chest.

I'd just started a new relationship and my partner was (and still is!), a very emotionally open/healthy person overall. He offered to ask his therapist for a recommendation and I figured I'd give it one last try.

The first time she and I met it was like nothing I'd ever experienced with a mental health professional. I was genuinely excited for our next session. She helped me delve into things I didn't even realize were the root of so many of my day-to-day (and more critical), issues. And, I think most importantly, she forced me to be EXTREMELY honest with myself. She could tell when I was - unknowingly - lying to myself even. 

Ultimately, I found myself getting so burnt out at work (which she'd recognized and been concerned about since... virtually the day we met), and helped me through the process of seeking SSDI (I was diagnosed with Bipolar Disorder Type 1 at 27 following a hypomanic, then manic, then psychotic episode which landed me in in-patient treatment for about 2 weeks). She pushed me to stop pushing myself, which may sound absurd, but it had become a way of life for me at that point. Learning to genuinely take care of myself and stop feeling ashamed for doing so was one of the greatest hurdles I've ever taken on, and she helped me over it.

HERE'S THE THING... I recently got to the point where I felt I'd re-built a stable, healthy, self-aware, consistent way of living, and I wanted to explore the idea of going back to work (not necessarily the same job, firm, industry, or even paid employment); I simply wanted to take the next step... dip my toes in, not dive into the deep end).

She was wary of this, and even referenced a number of times the work that she (willingly offered), had put in to assist in my application for disability status. When we spoke, I suddenly started feeling like she was putting me down or somehow making me feel like I was out of my mind for thinking I could broach this next step. After our sessions, I no longer felt uplifted, but rather... made to feel small? Incapable? Dependent?

It got to the point where I loathed our scheduled sessions each week and would find other things to talk to her about just to fill the time. I re-scheduled two sessions in a row, and ultimately wound up having an extremely uncomfortable conversation with her the other day, essentially explaining that our sessions were making me feel... badly about myself, essentially. She didn't ask much, we spoke for about 15 minutes, and... that was it.   


I didn't mean for this to be any sort of rant but just wondered if anyone else had had experiences similar to mine/what sort of feelings came up in the short-term afterward/recommendations for staying ""steady""?

When my dad comes home and ask if she took her meds , she lies and when he checks the meds and finds out she did not take it, he shouts just a little and gets angry at her. She just starts crying. We tried to explain her many times and if once she agreed, then after 2 days she forgets about it. One day when my dad got a little angry on her she started crying and said "" stop it you are killing me, do you want me to die?"". This was a shock to me because she didnt say  thinks like these before. After that whenever she cried she frequently said  that she wants to die. I know she wont take any big step because she  is very religious and self-harm is the biggest crime here. I want some advice on how to treat her.

I am going to try and keep this short. 

to start off, my bf \[32 M\] and I \[24 F\] have been together for almost 2 years now and live together. I just want to say that my boyfriend is a great human being, and we have a very special relationship and I want to stay with him - so please no comments telling me to break up with him because I really want to work through this. 

So not too long ago, I saw that my bf had a Kik account. I asked him why he had Kik, and he got super defensive and was being sketchy as hell but said it was for him to communicate to clients overseas for work, which makes sense for his line of work. I got angry, but ultimately I gave him the benefit of the doubt. 

before this; I had always been super suspicious about him taking these LONG ass showers, with the door locked. like im not a fucking idiot bro lol

a few weeks later while we were about to go to sleep, I had a gut feeling that something was wrong so I peered over his shoulder and saw him deleting the app. I immediately asked him about what was going on and told him to log in and I saw a bunch of messages with other guys, but Kik deletes the chat so I couldn't see the content. He ended up telling me that he was into gang bangs and he would send other guys my pictures and they would talk about fucking me together (he said they weren't nudes, and I do believe him - however I have no proof which still eats at me). He was extremely embarrassed, I was extremely angry, it was awful. We talked about it for days after, but I forgave him because it wasn't like he was talking to other girls, it wasn't cheating. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, im down with the kinky stuff for sure (I was even kind of flattered, weirdly), however it was a huge breach of my trust and I was disgusted to know that other dudes were jacking off to my pictures with the permission of the person I trusted the most. 

thats not even the worst part though

a few weeks later, I found out that he had an old, cracked phone that was in a chord bag that hasn't been touched in a minute. Me, being already in a state of mistrust, I turned that bitch on and went through it. What I saw will haunt me forever. 

To be fair, I know I shouldn't have gone through his old phone and I feel horrible about it, but I literally had to. I couldn't stand to be lied to again and I was gonna figure out for myself to see whatever was on there. 

When I turned It on, I see that it hadn't been used since 2017 (before we were together) so I was like, okay fine thats cool. I opened it, and I saw Kik on his phone. He used it with his exes pictures even AFTER they broke up,  he sent their nudes. (imagine seeing your boyfriends ex girlfriends nudes god I am so not okay). To be fair, both those gfs cheated on him and treated him like shit so he was probably going through it. He was also in a really bad spot in his life at that point. 

THEN, I see his Kik screen name. For privacy purposes I won't say what it is, but I looked it up on google and found the same screen name on archived 4chan message boards (from years ago) with at least 30 different posts about both of his exes (and one about Madison beer of course smh) basically talking about getting ""wins"" I imagine that means nudes? and trading them with other dudes who had other girls nudes and he would talk about gang banging these girls with other dudes over Kik. There were discord servers for it too.

When I confronted my boyfriend about it I was extremely angry and he couldn't even look me in the eye, he felt terrible and he cried. I think he was in shock because he probably forgot about it and buried it deep in his mind. He fully regretted it. He apologized profusely and has really been making efforts to repair our trust. He is completely transparent with everything, he even showers w the door open (how funny that his showers are literally 5 minutes now lol wow I WONDER WHY). He is doing everything in his power to make sure I trust him again, which I appreciate. 

However, its been like 3 months, and I still can't shake the feeling. I was horrified. I still am. I can't unsee the shit that I saw, I can't unremember the person he used to be. I just can't. It's so hard for me to move on. our relationship is amazing and always has been other than that, but whenever he is gone and there's nothing to distract me from the thoughts, they all creep in and I am in mental hell. They always pop up now and then, circling me like vultures. I don't want to keep bringing it up because we moved past it and there's literally NOTHING to say anymore, but sometimes I feel like I forgave him too fast. I don‚Äôt even know how to asses these feelings. I don‚Äôt know what to do. I feel like I have unanswered questions that were already answered, like ""are you sure you never sent my nudes"" and he says no, and like.. how am I supposed to believe you dude?? like its almost like I feel the need to ask him the same question over and over and over again like 100 times just to make myself feel better. I don‚Äôt know. what if he is telling the truth? 

I can forgive but I can't forget. I think I need therapy for this because I can't even tell my friends about this horrific shit or else they would hate him and try to make me break up with him.

Also I know that I need to be talking to a professional about this but I'm waiting to get some things lined out with insurance so I don't have that luxury on hand at the moment.

Every time my SO initiates sex, I do this thing where I just feel like all of a sudden he's the bad guy who is just dating me so that he can have someone to fuck. I feel used, worthless and extremely vulnerable.

I just shove all of that to the side and ignore it so that I can enjoy being with my man, but....

It's like I don't want to be doing this but at the same time, I REALLY don't know how to vocalize why I'm feeling this way, so I'm just not doing anything about it.

And even when I do open my mouth to say something, my mind goes blank and my throat closes up so I'm just like.. never mind.

It feels almost physically impossible to try to talk to him about how I'm feeling for so many reasons, but mostly if I talk about it, it becomes.. real I guess. 

Even writing about it on my phone is difficult.

There's a whole lot more trauma I'm dealing with such as being raised in a cult, multiple sexual assaults as an adult, being homeless and on the streets, having to run away from a pimp as a result of that not to mention I now have no self worth, a miscarriage less than two weeks ago, dating two narcissists back to back, one of which decided to gaslight me into a mental breakdown, and being bullied/ostracized by friends and even family growing up. 

Also I feel like the miscarriage has triggered my bipolar suicidal ideation so I also have THAT to deal with again and I hope to GOD that I don't end up back in the phsych ward.

I wonder if when therapists meet people like me if they look at me like something that's really hard to clean up but so satisfying when you get it all fixed up nicely, or if they're just like hmmm let me refer you to a specialist!

(To be honest at this point I've started laughing at how ridiculous and long this terrible list of tragedies is that I've accumulated throughout my life. It's either that or cry!)

h0fxr0,therapy,1591811082.0,"I‚Äôm a Black 23 y/o F who has escaped my hometown twice only to return. I use the word escape bc my family follows the same routine and it creates horrible psychological patterns and physical practices (financial, dietary, etc.) for me. *Disclaimer‚ÄîI believe in taking responsibility and accountability but i also know about systemic racism/ oppression and generational trauma. Before you try to say this is all Black people, understand there are social and psychological constructs that Black communities have been afflicted by that cause many social issues* 

Since as far as I can remember the patterns of my family include weekly fights (extremely physical), imprisonment, over dependence of religion to fix reality, fear based action, in family gossip, the works. I moved out at 17 to go to college and realized too late that I didn‚Äôt have a plan for staying out. I moved home for 2 years to plan. I moved out again out of country this time at 22 w/ plans on living abroad for atleast 5 years and enrolling into a masters program. I moved to China and worked for an English training center but due to Covid (and being a province next to Hubei) I decided to go home for safety and comfort and return after things cleared up. I had a roommate in China and didn‚Äôt want to leave her paying rent alone. In US, i would pay $450 a month so that she wasn‚Äôt completely responsible and I planned on returning. As the world began to unravel and restrictions were made the province I worked in began to show their racism to the world by blaming, evicting, prohibiting, etc. African and Black bodies from homes, businesses, schools xyz you name it. I cannot morally support living in a place such as this. I decided to still keep my end up with my roommate. I found out a few nights ago that my Chinese landlord has been advising my roommate that i haven‚Äôt been paying rent and she will be evicted unless she pays my portion. I‚Äôm livid. I erupt. It doesn‚Äôt matter. I screenshot all of my payments and send it to both parties and they still question the payments. 
RAnyways, I began to plan so that I can stay ahead and hopefully not fall into financial depression. Knowing I have places to stay in my hometown I put in for a job, got it, then began mapping for housing. I didn‚Äôt plan on moving to the town until I officially got my housing so that I can atleast have a physical escape route when things get too hectic. I landed an apartment and would work on a car before my new job began. Things are going great! I moved back home stayed with a relative for what was supposed to be 4 days until moving into the apartment. In those four days I experienced the cycles (one sister being evicted and threatening another sister, one sister giving birth while finding out another sister is pregnant, threats, fights, religious things, the works). Needless to say I‚Äôm ready to get my place. I call to schedule the walk through only to be told-‚Äúyour date has been changed.‚Äù OOOOK no problem keep it pushing. I get a call from a relative that lived in the area telling me to call for a billing inquiry bc they had many issues with the place before. I call and was told a ridiculous amount for a monthly bill. The monthly rate was essentially the same price as rent bc the landlord refuses to update the unit. 

*In the midst of all of this Breonna Taylor and George Floyd are murdered. If you haven‚Äôt guessed it, I‚Äôve experienced police brutality in my life. My father was murdered in front of my home by officers doing an illegal search for drugs w/o a warrant. I‚Äôve seen countless officers abuse their power and wrongly arrest members of my community just for standing outside. I was detained one spring break while visiting my family for sitting outside with a cousin. Narcotics was called and several cars pulled up to search and question my cousin and I. The reason: ‚ÄúThere was a cup on the ground and it‚Äôs illegal to liter.‚Äù This making our detainment justified. The cup was 8 feet away from where we were sitting. I‚Äôm triggered, my anxiety and depression erupts and I don‚Äôt feel like talking*

Anyways.....Okkkkk, what now? Try to find another option. I find another option and try to keep to my schedule bc I‚Äôm still working on China time and scheduling events for the new job, I‚Äôm busy af. The new landlord keeps making promises of dates. He‚Äôs a family friend, ok cool I‚Äôll be patient. I was supposed to move in yesterday, my off day. Am I moved in? Nope. I was told this morning the house didn‚Äôt pass an inspection I was unaware of so I have no idea when move in can be scheduled. I take it on the chin and call all of the utility programs scheduled to halt them less I‚Äôll be charged. ‚ÄúOk, this is adulting...it may not always be easy. Keep going!‚Äù I‚Äôm telling myself as the family member allowing me to stay charges in saying ‚ÄúMaybe this isn‚Äôt a Gods will...(etc).‚Äù I‚Äôm not particularly religious so I just stare at them as all of this crap swims around my head. All I can think is ‚ÄúMaybe I‚Äôm not supposed to be in this town. Maybe this is cosmic intervening trying to force me out. Or maybe this is my growth process. Maybe this will help someone in the future. Wtf is happening?!‚Äù

Last week I tried to kill myself. I walked into my va clinic with blood streaming and no one gave a shit. I took myself to my T's office and asked if he was available, and lucky for me he was. We talked, he didn't freak out. He talked me down, we shared a joke, and I left to talk to my boyfriend and tell him what happened. He next day was an appointment and we talked like normal, then today what I described above happened. IT GETS BETTER, if only in microdoses.

So my GF of 3 1/2 years ended up having to move out of state because of stuff with her family. She then told me she needed a ‚Äúbreak‚Äù from us because she felt she needed to be ‚Äúalone‚Äù for a bit. So we were on break for about a month and we texted and even FaceTimed a couple times a week. We were telling each other we weren‚Äôt doing anything with anyone else, and promised that we didn‚Äôt even want to. But I had picked up on random queues that made me suspicious, like a random guy would go over and she would be like yea I‚Äôm gonna help him wrap Christmas presents or some BS, weird things like that happened all the time. Then about a week ago she called me and said she was excited to tell me about something, then laughed and said we‚Äôre not getting back together and hung up then disappeared for a couple days. She then texted me a couple days later, wanting to come hang out with me. I was reluctant the whole time because I knew it would hurt me, I had been in so much pain the whole time we were on a break. she knew but didn‚Äôt care. but we made plans anyways, I was gonna go meet her and we were gonna hang out for a few days. Then I had decided not to do it, and I messaged her and I said that something else came up and we‚Äôre not gonna hang out anymore, then I blocked her to protect myself and I was going to move on. I then got texts from her friends over there, one of them was a video of her having sex with the guy I was suspicious about, and they sent me texts saying it had been going on for a while and trying to rub it in and stuff. What kills me the most is them giving oral to each other. That fuckn kills me. Later on that night, she emailed me the video herself I guess to make sure I got it. I didn‚Äôt watch it of course, but I saw what it was. The guy then texted me trying to rub it in. I didn‚Äôt respond to either of them. How do you guys suggest I go about dealing with this?

I don't want to say I didn't participate, because I did the first year and then I enabled.

Also, I think it was a lot of projecting our past trauma onto present people and events in an unfair way. I feel so ashamed that I used to be that way, holding my head that high, but I know enough now not to be that proud and rude.

anyway, I started distancing myself from those friends in my last semester, and since graduating and moving away, don't talk to any of them except one mutual friend.

Was a little wary at first, all of their messages seemed really cut and paste, but I figured it was just because they were default intro messages. Had a very hard time even getting a message back from her at all, signed up for  a video chat, since I have difficulty talking just over the phone, she was almost 15 minutes late and apologized that we had to do it over the phone because something had gone wrong, but she didn't want to just cancel. That was fine, god knows I know things don't always go to plan, the session wasn't exactly what I expected but she was really nice and I was really hopeful.

The next week I had another session, nothing went wrong, really, it was just kind of weird, I was expecting to talk about the things that had been bothering me, we talked about time management instead. Which, again, that's great, it wasn't at the forefront of my issues but it did help.

I wasn't able to get another timeslot with her for 2 weeks after that, frustrating but fine. Later that day, I asked if we could talk about something specific on my apt. And she said yes, she could help with that. The rest of those two weeks were dead air. She texted once asking how things were going, I responded honestly telling her I was struggling with school, no response. I waited for 30 minutes on my apt day, thankful it had come as I had had a horrible depressive episode over the weekend and she never showed. 3 days later, still no response or explanation.

My bf was there the moment I called him to tell him something bad happened. He was with me at the police station, and at the hospital while I got a kit done.

The thing is, my bf told me that he felt sketchy vibes from the guy before I even met up with him. But I didn‚Äôt listen. I know that it was my choices that put me in a dangerous situation, and I was being reckless. He knows this too and is rightfully upset that I let myself get into this situation. Like, he shouldn‚Äôt have to babysit me to make sure I make safe decisions. 

But he literally went through a traumatic event, and told me he also has flashbacks from that day. But he refuses professional help. How do I convince him that he should go to therapy? Or how do I help him despite being traumatized myself? He says ‚Äúeverything will still be the same even if I went so what‚Äôs the point‚Äù. I feel like he‚Äôs really stuck and isn‚Äôt coping healthily. 

We really want our relationship to survive this. He‚Äôs my best friend and favourite human being. I don‚Äôt know what I would do if my recklessness caused me to lose him. How do I help him? How do I save the relationship?

tldr; I was raped by a stranger from tinder and my bf is also traumatized by this but won‚Äôt get professional help. Our declining mental heath is putting a strain on our relationship.

Edit: more context. An ex-friend of mine invaded my boundaries by showing up at my house that night unannounced and inviting herself in when I told her not to come. To escape that situation, I panicked and stupidly put myself in a different situation that led to me getting attacked.

I had a bad therapist. She went on political rants and made me miss work things or appointments because she‚Äôd run sessions over by 30 minutes to 1.5 hours and it‚Äôd be almost impossible to get out of. she told me I had an eating disorder, changed her mind and said I was obese when I told her my Weight, and then told me I must be wrong about my weight when I stood up for her to see my full body (we‚Äôre over zoom). Then when I went to visit family over the holidays she told me she wouldn‚Äôt see me (wouldn‚Äôt say why despite me voicing wanting to continue sessions) and to call her when I was back from holidays. I decided to just not schedule again. She texted twice but I ignored it bc she‚Äôd honestly been so awful. 

Then on Wednesday, she emailed me saying she needed to get ahold of me because she‚Äôd never charged my copays and needed my five copays zelled to her ($100). I said I wasn‚Äôt comfortable with Zelle (seemed scammy) and asked how else I could pay. Today is Saturday and she‚Äôs since called me at least twice a day, left 1-2 voicemail each day, and emailed twice a day. 

Today she called three times and said first message she didn‚Äôt have my insurance info and she sounded mad. She said she needed it to get paid. I decided to sit on it til Monday because it was feeling unhinged. Second voicemail she says I‚Äôm ghosting her and need to get back to her asap. 

This is where I got creeped out. She called this evening reiterating everything and then asked if this was because I was on my parents insurance (I‚Äôve had a lot of family issues) and because I didn‚Äôt want to ask them for my insurance card so I was scamming her basically? I‚Äôm on my own insurance and this whole weird story was weird and jarring. Then she said she noticed I‚Äôd listed my mom as my emergency contact and she ‚Äúcould just call her to see what she thinks, hm?‚Äù

e9rxoz,therapy,1576177405.0,"I'm looking for different perspectives here because I'm not sure how to handle this situation. Grab a snack...

I found a therapist from my insurance company's covered provider listing, after reading good reviews about her on Google, Yelp, and another site (about 5 total reviews).¬† Each review mentioned how helpful, kind, and thoughtful she was. One reviewer mentioned they loved her ""quirks"" but didn't say what they were.

I sent a message to her through her website and got a call back a couple days later. She apologized for the delay and said she's very busy this time of year. I said no problem and arranged to meet with her the following week for an introductory session. At the time, she mentioned she would email me some paperwork to be filled in and signed, and that I could email it or print it and bring it with me. I remember she mentioned she's had some patients forget and it eats into their first session time, since it's only 50 mins. I said I would fill in the paperwork, no problem. I wrote down in my notes ""e-sign paperwork.""

I won't go into exactly why I'm seeing a therapist, there are multiple reasons, but after scheduling the appointment, I had a small breakdown and did a lot of crying. I felt a lot of despair and helplessness, but also some relief and hope that I would talk to someone soon who could potentially help me work through some things. That day was my son's birthday, so after the breakdown I gathered myself together, and we went about our activities for the day. His big birthday party was in a couple days so I also had a lot on my mind preparing for that. My parents came into town too, and everything went well.¬†

During the days leading up to the appointment I was looking forward to speaking with the therapist. Any time my issues came up, I would tell myself that relief was coming soon and try not to worry.¬†

The day of the appointment I arrived a few minutes early. No one was at the front desk so I called her. She came to the front and led me to her office. We did the usual greetings and sat down. She asked, ""Now there was some paperwork we discussed you would bring?"" I'm sure the look on my face made it clear; I said, ""I am sorry I completely forgot. I even wrote it down in my notes. After our call I had a bit of a breakdown and then a lot on my plate that weekend with my son's birthday. It totally slipped my mind. This is not like me.""

She said, ""Well did you at least call your insurance company to see this will be covered?"" I started to say ""No.. "" (and explain that I've already reached my deductible and out of pocket max, and if they didn't cover it anyway I would happily pay in full because I am really in need of this therapy), but before I could explain she got very angry.¬†

She stood up, somewhat close to me, and said, ""WOW you really aren't prepared today, are you?"" I was shocked by her response and said, ""No I guess I'm not."" She said, ""That's really not good. I think it's very rude actually. It's a pet peeve of mine.""

All I could say was, ""Okay, I explained what happened. I am normally very prepared."" I refused to apologize again. My first instinct was to BOLT out of the office but I took a beat to think it through - I was going to get charged for this session either way; I really need therapy right now; it's the end of the year and my deductible starts over in January, and if I find another therapist at best I could get one session in before the holidays - probably another intro session only. I also think I wanted to avoid further confrontation, and I'm very hesitant to overreact because it can't be undone. I try to take very measured responses to situations, maybe that seems weak to some (which seems to be the complete opposite of her reaction!).

So I sat there while she printed the papers and then I filled and signed the forms - it was basic info, HIPAA forms (spelled HIPPA which is a pet peeve of MINE), insurance info, etc. It really didn't take long, at most 10 minutes. But it's me paying for her time right? I took responsibility for not bringing the paperwork, I was fine with a somewhat shorter session because of it. So I was really confused why she got that angry.¬†

After that she started writing notes and asking me specific questions about previous therapy I've had, any prescriptions I am currently taking, what the names of my current doctors are, what I would like to achieve in therapy, etc.¬†

I started crying when discussing about my reasons, and I felt even more vulnerable because of how she had reacted to the paperwork. She asked about any losses I've had and I mentioned my grandparents had passed some years ago. Her response was ""Oh wow I'm so sorry."" For some reason it felt like a canned response. I'm in my thirties and some time has passed, it's sad but not like a surprise-inducing thing. I don't know, it seemed weird.¬†

She asked my level of education; it is the same level as hers, which she also seemed surprised by. It made me wonder if she judged me because I wasn't prepared on this first occasion.

Most of the session was her asking me questions and me giving somewhat short answers (no time to discuss). We scheduled one more appointment for the next week which would be the last of the year. I knew I had 24 hours to cancel so I could think about whether I wanted to go back.

So... I'm now debating whether to go or cancel. I'm trying to decide if her reaction was enough to make me look for someone else. At best her reaction wasn't constructive but maybe she believes in fully voicing how she's feeling at that moment? At worst she is an impulsive person who is more concerned with communicating her anger than giving her patients, who are obviously dealing with issues and searching for some help, the benefit of the doubt. I can only imagine how someone in a more fragile emotional state than me, someone who self harms or worse, would react to that type of response. I feel as though she judged me from the start and wonder if she can still be unbiased towards me and actually WANT to help me? It kind of seemed that way during the session but it's difficult to know for sure.¬†¬†

Either way I plan to tell her how her reaction made me feel. I'm just not sure whether I want to work it out in a session (maybe she is a good therapist but finds it very disrespectful, regardless of the reason, that I did not fill out the paperwork?), or if I will just tell her in an email why I am canceling the appointment.¬†Thoughts?


ETA: I just realized I never got an email from her with the paperwork. I looked through every inbox and junk mail box and there's nothing. There's not even an email address on her website, so I'm going to have to call her tomorrow and cancel my appointment over the phone.

Five minutes later my dad called me and asked if I heard the noise. I said yes. He asked me why I didn't come to check. I said I didn't think that anything was broken. Then they both started accusing me of not caring about them. Saying things like ""I'm sure if I'd fallen you wouldn't have come"" and ""how can we trust you to take care of us later if you don't even do this?"". 

This kind of pissed me off because I do care and they know it. They wouldn't be making my brother feel guilty like this. They know he doesn't care.

I‚Äôm on social media a lot and I see countless women share their scary and traumatic experiences with men all the time, and for a lot of women sadly these experiences are on a daily basis. You could say social media is giving me anxiety and rotting my brain, and that could be true, but I have had awkward and creepy experiences with men as well. I think the most recent one was in a Walmart parking lot walking to the building and an old man, definitely old enough to be my grandpa was walking past me going to his car and kind of loudly whispered to me ‚Äúhi honey‚Äù. I just ignored him and kept going. Thought that was weird. Luckily the situation didn‚Äôt escalate and he kept going on his way too. 

Another time I was inside Walmart and a middle aged man was like leering at me and I forgot what he said but I remember it was creepy, he had that creepy smile on his face and he went all like ‚Äúoh wow‚Äù or something like that obviously because he was attracted to me. I wasn‚Äôt even 21 at the time yet. It was awkward but I brushed it off. I tried not to pay attention to him but I was creeped out trying to keep my calm while internally freaking. And I think there have been some other weird experiences with men before. 

So while social media could be giving me more anxiety than need be, it doesn‚Äôt change the very real reality that women are always in fight or flight mode because you never know which men have bad intentions. I love wearing dresses, skirts and crop tops but I‚Äôm scared to wear those things now because I‚Äôm scared of men not being able to control themselves at the sight of some skin, which we ALL have.

la0x24,therapy,1612178324.0,"So basically my girlfriend and I broke up about a month ago. My ex has both anxiety and depression and, as a result, has (among other things) not much energy to deal with issues and things outside of ‚Äúnormal‚Äù everyday activities. We‚Äôd been having a few problems like not communicating very well with each other, not having really any hobbies in common, and I was getting the impression that often she simply didn‚Äôt want to talk to me at all, wasn‚Äôt putting as much effort as I was into the relationship and didn‚Äôt want to have much to do with me. So naturally I told her about those feelings and impressions I‚Äôd been getting, and that manifested into me telling her she wasn‚Äôt putting enough effort into our relationship, among other things. Later on I told her that occasionally I‚Äôd been getting fleeting thoughts that we weren‚Äôt meant to be because of the lack in common and lack of communication, and I told her that I didn‚Äôt pay them any attention and instead viewed them as a motivating challenge to work hard to fix our problems. She apparently viewed those thoughts a lot more negatively than I did. The relationship deteriorated from there, and she broke up with me only a few days after that. She said that the primary reason for us breaking up was that she didn‚Äôt have the energy to deal with our issues, that 80% of the reason she was breaking up with me was her and the other 20% me, and we ended on somewhat okay terms.

This next paragraph is about a month after breaking up (so very recently). One thing to mention is that we work together üòï. Somehow working together hasn‚Äôt ended up being super awkward. So one day I made a joke after she said it was really cold and told her maybe she should try working harder, and that apparently triggered her pretty bad, so she retorted with (I didn‚Äôt hear the entire thing): ‚ÄúMaybe I should try putting more effort into my relationships as well!‚Äù Or something along those lines. She got shut down pretty quickly by our coworkers who were aware of the situation, and afterwards I told her to please not bring any personal drama into work. She responded by saying that it was just a heat of the moment thing and that she was just really mad. She went on to explain that me telling her she wasn‚Äôt putting enough effort into our relationship had hurt, a lot, as she said she‚Äôd been giving her absolute all into the relationship. So we talked about that for a bit and basically I apologised a fair bit for saying that in the past, and I deeply regretted it. 

So the next day I hear from another coworker that she‚Äôd been chatting to yet another coworker about how toxic our relationship had been. So I confronted her about it because at that stage I didn‚Äôt think our relationship had been toxic, and basically she started out by saying ‚Äúif you think about it, it was. I wasn‚Äôt good for you, and it wasn‚Äôt fair on you for me to be with you when I was struggling‚Äù. I said I‚Äôd accepted that that‚Äôs what I was getting into at the start and I was going to try and help her through it, and that if I didn‚Äôt want to be in the relationship I wouldn‚Äôt have been. The following is a direct quote from a text message later that day from her talking about the reasons she thought it was toxic:

‚ÄúI didn't feel 100% comfortable if I'm honest. You said I wasn't putting in enough effort. That we weren't meant to be. You treated me the way I treated myself. I draw the line there. I'm angry at both of us, me for letting you get to that point, you for doing the damage. When you asked to extend it until the end of the holidays. I treat myself like shit. I have always struggled with relationships and I really thought that the one I had with you was going to be good for me, and wasn't going to negatively affect me. But it did, granted I already had those issues, but I can guarantee they're worse now. I went from where I was, to near rock bottom again. Any progress I had made over the course of the relationship was instantly gone. How we communicated sucked, we had nothing in common, we're too different. All of that has and still does affect me. I gave you everything I had, and you made me feel as if it was nothing. You made me feel more worthless than I already did, and I don't think I can ever forgive you for that. So that is why I say it was toxic. If I had let the relationship continue, it would have gotten worse. I am not the kind of person to deal with things that are mentally damaging, even if one of those things was my boyfriend. And I'm not sorry for saying that it was toxic towards the end. I'm just sorry It was also unfair on you‚Äù

And that message has basically broken me more than I ever have been before. I feel like I am a complete arsehole, like I have ruined her life, and like I am a danger to anyone else I might have a relationship with in the future because of the absolutely horrible impact I‚Äôve had on her life. My confidence is shattered, and even now I‚Äôm struggling to process how much of a horrible person I‚Äôve been.

upl9sw,therapy,1652546976.0,"Hi so I came here to share my own experience with BetterHelp in hopes that it‚Äôll help people make an informed decision about joining as a patient. (TLDR at the end) 

So for starters I joined BH as an alternative to my previous therapist that stopped taking insurance after moving to telehealth. The price is comparable to out-of-pocket therapy especially if you‚Äôre a student or have a promo code. However, I have had nothing but bad experiences with therapists on this platform. 

The first therapist I was matched to sounded like a perfect fit. She had live video availability and I booked an apt. When the day came, she initiated a call instead of the video chat that I had scheduled. This was okay, but 25 minutes in to the 45 minute appointment, she started trying to end the call. She claimed that we could go more in depth at her private practice and talk about more there. She said she wouldn‚Äôt have any BH availability and I could book my next apt through her practice instead. So i immediately changed. 

My next therapist again seemed like a great fit, but no availability. When I messaged to schedule, she informed me that she only does messaging therapy. This would mean we would text back and forth for 45 minutes which I just don‚Äôt see being as effective as it‚Äôs hard to portray emotions through text the way you can on a phone call. 

I switched again and this time got a therapist with phone call availability, I scheduled an appointment and made plans to be home from work at that time so I could be present for the appointment. The day before she informs me that she doesn‚Äôt do calls and only messaging, even though she had phone calls listed on her schedule as available. Extremely unprofessional in my opinion that she had phone calls as an option, and it was such a let down so I once again changed. 

Now i‚Äôm matched with my final therapist (final because i‚Äôm cancelling BH). She has one hour available each week (1:00 on a thursday‚Ä¶) and when I asked about scheduling outside of that time she informed me that I would have to go through her private practice if I wanted scheduling flexibility. 

I‚Äôm incredibly shocked that BH promotes so much but fails to monitor the therapists they take on. A month has been wasted with only one 25 minute appointment that gave me no value and was just a private practice promotion. I am just so disappointed with this whole experience and really recommend that anyone considering BH looks elsewhere first before wasting a lot of money on this. I‚Äôm sure there are great therapists out there on BH, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worth the price when it‚Äôll take upwards of a month to find one. 

TLDR: Personally, I have not found a therapist that cares about me on BH and i‚Äôve wasted a lot of money for only one apt that was cut 20 minutes short.",https://www.reddit.com/r/therapy/comments/upl9sw/beware_of_betterhelp/,Beware of BetterHelp,,59,8,0.98

This week, I was thinking back on something that happened in one of our sessions and had a panic attack. The next day I was still really anxious and believed that I couldn‚Äôt go back in and sit for the next session without puking or being so anxious I couldn‚Äôt speak. I sat on it for hours but the feeling became so unbearable I emailed him out of our therapy hours for the first time ever. 

I couldn‚Äôt imagine what he could say to make me feel remotely better and by this point my mind is flipping out with all sorts of further anxious thoughts about what his response might be, but his reply was honestly so GOOD.

It gently reminded me to observe the feeling and stay grounded, and also mentioned that the anxiety would come in waves but they would subside, and the feeling would pass. He added at the end that he‚Äôd see me in the next session. 

I obvs wasn‚Äôt instantly cured but I felt so much better... his email completely held my emotion without feeding it, and him knowing the anxiety would come in waves eased it as I thought it would build and build, and was getting to a point where I was fearing the anxiety itself. His email allowed me to step back and observe it - not to ‚Äúcalm down‚Äù (I couldn‚Äôt) but recognise that it wouldn‚Äôt be forever.

I am seriously impressed at this... and wanted to say to all therapists on here, you do an amazing job and change people‚Äôs lives.

So I've had a rough year; between Covid lockdowns and a toxic relationship (which I finally freed myself from a couple months ago), I am in a pretty bad place with stress, anxiety, feelings of numbness and heavy brain fog.

I've started seeing my therapist about two months ago, I like her and I think she's a competent professional.

The thing is, I feel worse since I've started seeing her and I'm perplexed. We have started to dig into why I let this person (with whom I had a toxic relationship with) treat me the way she treated me for all those months. We're uncovering stuff that is rooted in my childhood.

Well, guys...I feel pretty bad. My anxiety has gotten worse, I noticed I constantly grind my teeth and I'm really tense all the time. I also frequently wake up about two hours before my alarm, and after a few seconds I feel the anxiety kick in with a strong pressure on my forehead, which lasts basically all day until the sun comes down.

However, the other side of the coin is that I'm being to sensitive towards other people's feelings and opinions, and it's very painful. If someone criticizes me i take it very personal, and it absolutely destroys me. 

If i say something hurtful, which I often do due to tasteless humor, and someone gets hurt, it absolutely breaks me. Even after I've apologized and they forgive me. I just start to hate myself for days, sometimes weeks.

Conflict terrifies me as well. If someone disagrees with me, i somehow take it personally and it hurts me, because I feel like they dislike ME and not my opinions.

pixbqw,therapy,1630926388.0,"Growing up I have always been a people pleaser. From as far back as I can remember, my entire life was spent being preoccupied by the needs and wants of others and knowing it was my duty to meet them, even if it cost me my own comfort. I think this is rooted in the fact that I was molested as a child by three different people in my family (not my parents but a family friend, a babysitter and my uncle). At the age of ten, I was sexually groomed by an 18 year old daughter of a family friend. I'm no psychologist, but I'm self-aware enough to know that there is clearly a link there. I was also emotionally abused by my parents. It was not intentional on their part as they both had tough lives and weren't emotionally ready to care for a child, especially one that was unplanned. So I don't hate or judge them for it. However, I'm sure there is a strong link there too. More specifically I grew up afraid of my mother because she had the tendency to rage and lose her temper when angry. Even if it was something small, hell would break loose. Again, I do not judge her for it. But I am still really scared of her to this day, despite the fact that I'm 25 years old and should be a grown adult. I don't feel like one.

My entire life, all I ever worked for was the approval of others. Family, friends, friends of friends, you name it: for as long as I felt there was a chance to be liked and accepted, I took it. I was one of the only guys to not have a girlfriend in my class at a boys school; I felt left out and uncool and some made fun of me for not having a girlfriend. So I came in to school a few days later and pretended as if I had one. I was so scared of them making fun of me again that I made this up.

Now, I just want to make one thing clear. I am not a pathological liar. I don't lie about things concerning my daily life or some of my opinions or what I ate or anything like that. When I describe myself as a chronic liar I mean I often will omit my truth or lie in a moment when I sense that someone will disapprove of me. So for example, my girlfriend is really judgemental and often makes fun of my interests; so if I participate in my interest that day, I won't tell her and I will pretend as if I did something else. Or for example my mother doesn't take ""I don't know"" for an answer; so if she asks me a question, I give a fake answer even if I don't know because she will be annoyed with me otherwise. In high school, when I studied hard for an exam but didn't get the grade I wanted, I was punished. So i started to hide my grades from my parents. Or sometimes I would only tell them the grades I know they would be happy with. In my friend group, if someone expresses an opinion I disagree with, I either keep quiet or I pretend to agree because I'm afraid of retribution. That kind of thing (though with my friends I feel more safe so it isn't often that this happens). In essence, I always want to be in good books with people and so I use omission of the truth or blatant lies to protect myself from disapproval or rejection. I learned from a very young age that disapproval comes with punishment. 

Now I am in a situation I never thought I'd ever be in. I was supposed to graduate 3 months ago. But I failed last semester. I have to retake courses this semester in hopes to graduate in January. No big deal (in the grand scheme of things) right? Fail a few class, retake them and then graduate only a few months later. I know I am not the only one in this kind of situation.

But here's the catch. I am too afraid to tell my family. I lied that I am still waiting for my final result. But i have been stalling the truth. I am back in school now and my parents think i came back here to collect my stuff. I developed a really bad flu while here. I took this chance to lie to them that I have COVID (even though I don't), so I don't have to go back home. I regret this because i have had COVID in the past and it sucked. And I know it is a serious thing to lie about. But i panicked and did what I thought was best at the time. So now I have a really bad flu in bed and my family think I have COVID again. In reality, I am just VERY afraid of them. 

Every time i pick up the phone to call them to tell them the truth, I go back to being 10 years old all over again; sitting on the floor while my mother beats me with a belt because she found out I was being molested by an 18 year old girl. All I remember are the times she would yell at me for not cleaning properly or compare me to my best friend for getting better grades than me. I remember the times she would give me silent treatment for a whole day because I didn't wake up on time during Thanksgiving. I remember that frightened child. I still feel like that frightened child.

mbmkwv,therapy,1616527542.0,"So this has been creeping up on me for a while and my therapist has been putting off having me explain the details until I give her the signal. I'm actually feeling lately like I can't keep carrying it alone, so today might be the day I tell her.

We've been through the childhood stuff, the anxiety disorders, and the very basic details of the sexual stuff (multiple events and multiple people, sort of ""ambiguous"" consent and murky memories of each thing). Last week she asked why I'm protecting them, why I won't tell people in my life what happened and I'm afraid to make honest and private accusations. The truth is that I still don't believe I deserve to feel as horrible about it as I do.

The first thing was a blowjob, that's it. It was my best friend and I liked him a lot and he lied and said he wanted to be with me so he could take my virginity. And in his dorm while no one was there he told me he was going to teach me how to give a blowjob. When he said, ""Ready?"" I told him I was scared and I could feel myself starting to panic, but he pulled up a chair and he said I'd be okay and he held my head down the entire time while I choked and coughed and tears ran all over my face. And I hate admitting that it was something so small because it feels like should have moved on. When my boyfriend now asked why I couldn't do it for him, and I told him, even he seemed to think it was the tiniest thing to be afraid of.

I think the rest of what happened was somewhat my fault, because less than a week after what my friend did I had a first date, and he cancelled the plans. He told me he wasn't feeling well, wanted to go to his house instead. That's how I lost my virginity. I didn't let myself say no, even when he wouldn't wear a condom and it hurt really bad. In the end he just got mad that I bled everywhere, and we kept dating but he slept with a friend of mine. The next time I tried to touch my body was four months later, and I cried.

The recent one was my ex boyfriend. He brought me to his house on our first date (again) and he never asked for consent. He did it again the next night. I feel like this one's on me because we kept dating after, and I gave up on telling him no, and I forced myself to see the sex as a sign that he liked me and wanted to be with me, even though it was all he was willing to do with me and he still slept with other girls the whole time. The narrative our coworkers got was that I was a slut, and he used me, and I've internalized that to the point I'll never really not believe it.

My therapist has been talking a lot about the trauma chairs, how there's self-blame and anger and peace and all that. I spend a lot of time in the anger chair but I always end up back in self-blame.

(TW mention of self-harm and suicide, no graphic details)

&#x200B;

I'm just going to put it all out there since I feel like I have nothing left to lose at this point. I had my first major depressive episode when I was 12 but can remember feeling what I now recognize as mild  depression as early as 8.

I had my first suicide attempt and started self-harming at 14 and have been in and out of therapy since. Had a few more attempts since then, one at 16, one at 17, and two at 19. Am now 25. Started taking meds when I was able to leave home at 18, but didn't really have a solid support system until after the last attempt when I met my psychiatrist and therapist. I was also put in an 8 week long IOP group for DBT at that point, put in the work and haven't hurt myself or had to be hospitalized since then.

I've been through about a dozen meds over the years. Once we find an okay combination, it's normally okay for about a year and then becomes less effective. Have been on this current combination for about 2 years. I did 6 weeks of TMS a few years ago which helped me feel the most 'normal' I've ever felt for about 6 months.

When I'm in a major episode, I feel overwhelmingly sad, like I'm drowning. I stop being able to sleep, tend to not have an appetite and lose a bit of weight, have trouble focusing, feel deep guilt and shame for existing and have trouble concentrating and enjoying anything at all. This is not what it's like now. I just feel existentially exhausted and apathetic about everything. Like depression is a weighted blanket over my head. But it's so heavy and takes so much energy to take off, so I've just accepted that this is how it is and exist because I have no other choice.

I'm not as active as when I used to be an elite athlete, but I do get in exercise at least 3 days a week. I'll be honest, I probably don't eat enough. Likely due to leftover effects from a lifetime of a body image based sport, a lack of appetite and no energy to cook anything. If we're really being honest, there are some days that I'm hungry but I don't make anything because I don't care about whether I'm healthy or not, because it won't make a difference anyway. Sleep sucks and kind of always has since I was a kid. I take my meds at the same time every day, haven't missed a day in a long time. So basically I'm doing everything right, but it doesn't make a difference.

I'm in a long term relationship, have a few good friends, and recently adopted a kitten. Am out of a job right now but am working on some online courses and grad school applications. Have tried lots of things, but don't have any hobbies or anything that brings me joy. I just really don't give a shit about anything and have no motivation to do anything. I love my kitten, my partner and my friends, it just doesn't feel like they matter in the grand scheme of things. Nothing does.

I realize that being happy 100% of the time isn't realistic. I just want to be able to feel it more often than fleetingly. Assuming that's possible. My therapist and psychiatrist are out of ideas. Therapist says to keep working on my larger goals and using coping skills as needed. Psychiatrist says just hang in there as more rapid effect drugs will likely be approved in the next year. TMS again isn't an option financially.

tl;dr I'm doing everything right and there's nothing wrong with my life, but I still feel like garbage. The meds keep me afloat at a 3-4/10, otherwise I'm just here in limbo. Existing. With my treatment-resistant depression that sucks balls, but I don't really care. Because apathy. Thanks brain.

I find myself struggling to talk to people about my emotions and the anxiety and depression I go back and forth between because I don't want to burden them with all of that. I have a lot to talk about and work through and I don't have anyone I'm comfortable getting it all off my chest to.

I was crying today just because I got hit with a wave of depression, and for some reason I've been taking pictures of myself lately while in that stage, tears and all. I feel like it's sort of a marker for me to where I want to work to get past for myself.

Well then I thought, ""I need to talk,"" and so I just turned on my camera and started videoing myself talking. I had it on selfie mode so I could see myself, because I've always been told I'm a good listener, so it was kind of nice to listen to myself for a change.

They started to try CPR and chest compressions and all that stuff. They had been at it for 45 minutes by the time i got there. They would give him adrenaline and his heart would flutter then immediately flatline.

ssv8qt,therapy,1644902271.0,"My girlfriend sustained an extreme amount of verbal, psychological, sexual, and physical abuse throughout her entire childhood and adolescence. In adulthood, she was groomed by many different predators, most 20+ years her senior, and consistently and unknowingly re-victimised herself to abusive conditions similar to the ones she endured as a child. None of this information was disclosed to me until after 6+ months of us dating, which is understandable; yet, with the disclosure of this information, my life, and our relationship, have been pure hell. 

She didn‚Äôt remember much, if any, of her childhood, and as she began learning/remembering more about the abuse she endured, she decided to seek professional help. I chose to stay by her side as she decided to embark upon this journey because I love her so much and didn‚Äôt want her to feel or be alone throughout this process. I wanted to support her because I admired her strength, courage, and bravery. I just wanted to be there for her in any way I could, but I‚Äôm almost certain I made the wrong decision. I should have left. 

I now feel like I‚Äôm overly invested and enmeshed in her web of complex trauma. I‚Äôve dealt with so much from her, I almost feel as though I‚Äôm suffocating. Most recently, I‚Äôve witnessed my girlfriend repeatedly allowing her abusers to have access to her, which subsequently leads to a cycle of her re-victimising and re-traumatising herself. I also find it quite disturbing, and cannot fathom, how she allows these disgusting people to have contact or access to her. It‚Äôs confusing, frustrating, and draining. I literally feel like I‚Äôm going mad.

She will cry and emotionally breakdown to me about harmful, awful things that she‚Äôs endured while with these people, and it hurts me so badly to see her hurting. She will continuously confide in me about the disappointment she feels because she can‚Äôt believe she allowed herself to be subjected to these horrid acts. She appears to have a moment of clarity and growth, swearing these people out of her life, then will communicate with them a week later, as though everything is alright; as though she wasn‚Äôt just inconsolable at the thought of these people.

I‚Äôm afraid she has been too traumatised to escape the grasp of manipulation and control that these abusers have on her. I‚Äôm afraid she will never be able to separate herself from the mentality of normalising the actions abusers and abusive situations because that‚Äôs all she‚Äôs ever known. She will lash out at me and treat me like shite, yet, when an advantageous paedophile or predator whose abused her contacts her, she is unfazed. 

I‚Äôve allowed her trauma to wholly consume me, and I have been abundantly patient, supportive, and understanding, but now I have reached my limit. I care about her so deeply and want to see her overcome this battle, but I am fed up, and starting to realise she may just be too mentally fucked up or too far gone. I feel guilty for feeling this way, but my mental health is now greatly suffering as a result of dealing with all of this, and I have lost myself. I don‚Äôt want to abandon her while she is in such a fragile state, but I have started to resent her and I no longer want to be with her.",https://www.reddit.com/r/therapy/comments/ssv8qt/dating_a_trauma_survivor_has_unconsciously_been/,Dating a trauma survivor has unconsciously been one of the worst mistakes of my life.,,59,27,0.91

Hello everyone, throwaway account for privacy reasons. 
My wife and I used to have a wonderful sex life. At least once day if not more when our schedules allowed it. 
I knew my wife had issues with intimacy due to what she described as ‚Äútrauma‚Äù when we met, I made sure to let her take her time, communicated constantly and eventually we came to a place where she was confident and trusting, and we both enjoyed our intimacy very much. 

Before I get to our current issue, I want to make it clear that I absolutely am still head over heels for this woman. She is my soulmate, my person, and we are both crazy about each other. It isn‚Äôt the same as in the beginning of our relationship, but we have grown together and I love her more each and every day. There is no doubt in my mind that she feels the same.

Now, over the course of our relationship, I have discovered that the trauma that she was referring to was actually repeated sexual assault and rape by multiple men when she was very young. No one apart from me is aware of this. Ten months ago she thought she saw one of her abusers, which triggered an intense ptsd episode that took hours of consoling her to get out of. Our sexual relationship understandably took a dive. Three months ago another one of her abusers was at a wedding we went to, and despite my best efforts to keep him away from her, he got close to her while I went to the bathroom and said some vile things to her. Since then, it has been hard for her to even be touched. 

Nightmares are constant, sex is completely off the table (although we have started to  cuddle and have romantic dates again). I fully support her and don‚Äôt want to force her into doing anything. But‚Ä¶ I am an incredibly sexual person and it is hard for me to cross out that part of my life. I‚Äôve told her I would wait as long as it takes, but she is scared I will leave. 

Has anyone here dealt with something similar? How do I let her know she has nothing to fear? How can I prepare myself for a sexless marriage if that is what she needs? How can I help her heal and make her feel safe again?

Any advice and/or similar experiences greatly appreciated.",https://www.reddit.com/r/therapy/comments/rmlrpw/dead_bedroom_due_to_assault_helping_someone_who/,Dead bedroom due to assault - helping someone who is a survivor,,57,21,0.97
r83e9i,therapy,1638550111.0,"So I am on my third therapist, and debating with myself in regards if I want to bother trying to find a fourth. I am hesitant to bother at all because I usually always feel worse after sessions than going in, and I am not exactly sure what I am supposed to be getting out of therapy?

The long story.
I have been struggling with Anxiety and Depression for nearly 20 years now, stemming from CPTSD. I spent nearly a decade trying to help myself using online resources, and in the past two years I sought professional help.

The first one was a councilor that specialized in talk therapy. I spent about 3 months, one session a week, discussing my past with them, basically opening up about it and answering questions, assuming that by the time that was all unpacked we would get to the healing part. But after those three months, the councilor said that I ""had it all figured out"" and moved me to once a month check-ins. I had no odea what therapy actually occured and I just felt deflated that I opened up to a person and received no actual help.

Second therapist was a psychologist, and we spent about 3 months, once per week, doing CBT, DBT, EMDR, IFS, and a few other acronyms to no effect. CBT and DBT seemed very gaslighting in regards to trauma. (Yes, I logically know my life is not in danger, that's not the point, I want to quit my reactions when someone raises their voice). EMDR just seemed like it was a placebo and didn't budge it. IFS is just weaponized DID. Eventually I started feeling suicidal post sessions due to despair so I quit.

Third therapist is a councilor that had a 'person focused' approach, and been seeing them for 6 months one per week. I had really tried with this one, been entirely honest and even pushed myself to be more challenging so I can get explanations, even approaching him, multiple times, in regards to therapy not working. He eventually approached me saying that ""Therapy can really only help the psychological issues, and while there is some work we can do for that, you are very aware of that. The majority of your issues are either biological or environmental and therapy can't really address those."" And he basically put me on once a month check-ins as well.

Which, okay, whatever, fair enough I suppose. He's the professional and despite my natural inclination I trust his experience. But I still don't understand the 'point' of therapy? Is it really just talking about your issues that is supposed to make you feel better and some advice that I could read on a psychologytoday article?",https://www.reddit.com/r/therapy/comments/r83e9i/what_exactly_is_therapy_supposed_to_do/,What exactly is therapy supposed to do?,,59,43,0.96
qdxlgd,therapy,1634962534.0,"I had a strange interaction with a counselor today who seemed a bit woo woo and money hungry to me... I want to leave a Yelp review but I don't know if I'm overreacting to the situation or if it really is as unethical as it felt. Curious to hear from other counselors...

Here's the story of our phone call and what I was planning to write in my review:

""I spoke with (counselor) over the phone for a first time consultation. I have had social anxiety for much of my life and was interested in working through that. She did a really detailed consultation and seemed like she had some positive ideas for how to help which I appreciated. I shared that I feel like my anxiety affects my ability to make friends and focus at school and work. We spoke for about 45 minutes to an hour before the topic of insurance and cost of treatment came up. She does not accept insurance because, in her words, she doesn't do counseling  but uses other healing modalities which is interesting because her bussiness is called ""(---) Counseling"". I am a student and told her that I wanted to be realistic about what I can afford/ She told me she charges $150 per session. I asked her if she could estimate how many sessions I may need. She asked me if she could ""ask my body a question"" and then mumbled for a moment and produced that she was feeling I would need 8 sessions. This would equal $1200 dollars in total. I said that I would need to think about it and I would get back to her. She proceeded to tell me that I should ask my parents, husband, and family members for money. I right away felt like that was a strange suggestion since she knows nothing of my family situation other than the details I had just told her in our consult. I kind of said ""Ya ok, I'll think about it and let you know but realistically it may be too much for me right now"". She then proceeded to tell me that if I didn't spend this money now, I could potentially be lonely forever, not learn how to make friends, be unsuccessful in school, and eventually not earn as much money in my career. I found this so inappropriate because in the consult she had asked me my biggest fears about not dealing with my social anxiety and what my biggest hurdles were. I shared with her that I felt very lonely at times and felt like I wasn't able to make friends. I told her that I felt like she was pressuring me to spend money I don't have and she apologized but then continued to tell me that I should ask my family for money. She even told me about another client she had who asked his wealthy uncle to pay for his sessions with her.

I understand that this is her bussiness and she can choose how much to charge. I don't even find her rates to be unreasonable, however I felt that her comments were manipulating and unprofessional. Using a persons weakness and trauma that they just shared with you in order to make them feel like they won't be happy without you/your service is textbook manipulation. Maybe I am reading too far into this I got a very negative feeling- and hey she did say I'm an empath so maybe I'm onto something...""",https://www.reddit.com/r/therapy/comments/qdxlgd/strange_and_unprofessional_consult_with_counselor/,Strange and unprofessional consult with counselor...

ogte7b,therapy,1625829188.0,"Last night I spent some time thinking about my childhood (random thoughts in the A.M.s lol) and I came to notice I couldn't remember most of it. This all pointed straight to memory repression. I did some digging into myself and found something I thought was really interesting.

When I was younger life was good and all. But at some point my dad started getting more distant and tired and hung around with me less and less. This was correlated with his added load in his job. The result of this was that when he was around, he'd want everything to be quiet and still and I'd be told to shut up or keep it down everytime I got too loud. Naturally, I obeyed my parents as a young impressionable kid and since I didn't leave the house very often (home schooled) these notions were internalized. 

Fast forward to now, I always find it hard for me to express myself which affects the conversations I have with people and as a result, my friendships. I just can't bring myself to say anything more other than ""haha yeah"" and other things as such. So now, having secured my emotions in a healthier way, I think I am ready to bring myself out.

It was our first date yesterday and they did it unexpectedly, but I didn‚Äôt complain. I am very inexperienced they literally gave me my first kiss and blowjob on the same day.

After that it‚Äôll be a 3 year age gap. I don‚Äôt know if that is weird. Also, they said that they think I am cute whenever I am nervous and indecisive.
They also bit and scratched me hard,my chest and lower abdomen are covered in purple bruises.

They also tried to make me choke them but I half assed it because I didn‚Äôt want to do it. They basically took full control and just asked if I liked what they were doing. They told me hands off. After, I said to try not to bite me hard and they said they‚Äôll probably do it again anyways.

They also said I can‚Äôt touch them, which was weird because they were the one that reached into my pants and pulled out my dick. I kind of just agreed to whatever they wanted.

I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd miss the modern amenities too much, already too jaded to enjoy anything anyway. Too depressed to care about entertainment or hot water or any of that shit. Already eat canned food most nights. I dunno, I guess it‚Äôs easy to say while you‚Äôve got them, but I really think I could live just fine without all the shit.

And I dunno what it is about an apocalypse that really appeals, maybe it‚Äôs the constant threat of death. Which is weird, cause I‚Äôm always suicidal (I guess that‚Äôs another benefit for me too, it‚Äôs liable to just kill me), but something about the stakes almost always being life or death, I feel like that would actually motivate me to actually *want* to live. Or maybe it‚Äôs just the adrenaline or the constant distraction of potential danger. But I feel like it kickstart my survival instinct. At least for a while.

Or maybe it‚Äôs more that everything about life almost becomes a problem to solve and the side of my brain that likes focusing on external problems rather than my own internal ones likes the idea of that. There‚Äôd be a never-ending stream of problems to solve, lighting fires, building shelters, figuring out how to jury rig infrastructure like power, plumbing, water heating systems, animal traps, farming solutions, all these things, every day something new. Get bored or frustrated with solving one problem?  Well, provided it‚Äôs not critical to your survival, you can just drop it and move onto something more appealing at the time. Just move from practical task to practical task forever. But not just random bullshit you‚Äôre only doing to distract yourself, actual important things, thing with genuine applications to you daily life, things that are actually useful and they you personally will use and see continuous benefits from solving.

Or maybe it‚Äôs just the thought of finally being free. Money won‚Äôt matter. ‚ÄúSuccess‚Äù won‚Äôt matter. Your ability to work a meaningless 9-5 without wanting to fucking kill yourself won‚Äôt matter. Only wits and resourcefulness and only traits with actual value will matter. If someone fucks with you, you can just shoot them. If someone deserves to die, you‚Äôre free to make it so. And people are free to do the same to you. Feels real, in a way.

I wrote a suicide note and I plan to text it to them to see their reactions just before I commit suicide. the note has some circumcision stuff and I might include this reddit post.

Here's my anti circumcision argument:
The parents should NOT be the ones to choose if their child should be circumcised, here's why:

You wouldn't force your child to get a certain job, no! you would let them choose what's they think is best for themselves, because its their life, not yours.
So why can the parents make the choice to circumcise their child?
What, a dumb argument about STDs being less likely? well the child isn't going to be having sex at 18 months for it to matter. When the child is old enough to have sex they are also old enough to choose if they want to remove their foreskin and risk damaging their penis.

I see no reason to remove the foreskin without consent and risk medical problems, because when the child is older and will sex then they can make their own decisions about it.

and then if I don't hug something (mostly my pillow) anxious feelings wave in and I can really focus much on anything

I am really fine on being alone, in fact I love being alone, but this anxiety/desperation for a kiss and hug infuriates me, but ironically it's really a way to ease my anxiety

i am single I don't have a significant him/her yet (yes I am bisexual) but that won't affect things anyway

Dear God, Buddha, or Lord Santa Claus :

I did something naughty today, which may come as a shock to You since I‚Äôve spent most of my life being a dull, obedient, pencil-pushing point dexter who‚Äôll likely die from butt cancer as a result of sitting too often.

On this Monday, I took Mumma‚Äôs precious pooches for their daily constitutional. I led them towards the parks that sprawl her apartment complex. It went rather well; Mumma‚Äôs dogs behaved sensibly and did not succumb to the temptation of terrorizing innocent squirrels. The weather was cool, my mood jolly.

The way back to Mumma‚Äôs stretched past a set of units that housed my fellow neighbors, and there I noticed an SUV with its trunk door open, which revealed a case of water bottles. A young woman, which I later discerned to be the owner of the vehicle, stepped out her home and headed towards it. I had already walked a good twenty feet past this particular car when I heard that spritzy gal holler a furious ‚ÄúDON‚ÄôT YOU DARE!‚Äù out her mouth.

It didn‚Äôt register at first. I honestly thought she was yelling at someone else until I did a double take and noticed no one was on the street beside us. Even more, I caught her staring daggers at me before she deftly lowered her gaze, somehow trying to remain covert without noticing that her body remained moored in my direction. She defensively clutched the case of water bottles close her chest as this unfolded.

I was outraged! Sure, I can understand we are in living pressing times with the COVID-19 outbreak, I get that resources are somewhat limited, and I can infer that there are unscrupulous people who are not above flouting their morals to meet their needs, but seriously? Did she expect a bespectacled fat man, leash on each hand trying to restrain two canine terrors, to steal her water?

She quickly disappeared into her unit, and I did not say anything to her. The pets and I returned home. I swallowed most of my damaged pride and tried to let go of the situation. However, the remaining part that could not get past my throat imbued me with the incentive to return to the park with a plastic bag and scoop the largest, slimiest, foul-smelling turd I could find. I later proceeded to smear all its contents over the trunk of my nemesis‚Äô vehicle. Take that, you monster.

I am not asking for forgiveness, God/Buddha/Lord Santa. I just want you to bear witness to my experience. To be honest, this mischief gave me a rush that I have not felt in quite a while, a little panacea to the crushing weight of being a such a gosh-darned square, a goody two-shoes, a freaking boy scout that feels empty despite following all the rules he was strictly told to follow.

Recently, my Mom asked me if I was ever Sexually Assaulted as a kid. My immediate response was ""no"", because I have no recollection of anything like that ever happening, but now I'm thinking about it more, and I'm not so sure.

The thing that keeps coming back to me and concerning me is the dreams I remember having as a child. I always had wild dreams as a child, and strange dream ""behaviour"". 
As far back as my memories go (about 2) until about the age of 6, I had nightly, extremely vivid reaccuring nightmares that I can remember to this day. From about 6 to 10, I would sleepwalk/talk, and had extremely realistic dreams, and would often have a hard time differentiating between dreams and reality (whether or not something had happened in a dream or real life, whether or not I was really awake or still dreaming), and from then until about 14 I had what I called ""Deja-Vu"" dreams, where I felt I dreamed things before they happened.

The recurring nightmares from my early childhood are what concern me most. Because at this age, I did not know what sex was. I know I was aware that boys and girls had different parts (I had a little brother) and I knew the proper names for my body parts, but that's about it. And yet I remember many of my nightmares from this age featuring (what I now recognize to be) sexual assault.
As I was a child who didn't know what sex was, most of what I dreamt did not include ""traditional"" sexual acts, but rather what a child might associate with sex such as nakedness, ""potty"" stuff, humiliation. Or, sometimes, I simply understood that what happened to me after I woke up was the horrible thing that sometimes happened to little girls. A lot of the dreams included me being naked, and treated as an inanimate object such as a doll (or worse things that I'm not even comfortable thinking of let alone typing out), and most of the dreams involved my parents allowing these things to happen to me. My abusers were often a family that babysat me, or figures from tv shows and movies, such as Barney. Occassionally my abuser was my father.
I never told my parents about those parts of my dreams, because even as a very small child I was ashamed and afraid of what they might mean. 

After these dreams started, I became extremely interested in sex. I would act out sexual acts with my friends, or secretly look up pornography on the computer at as young as 6 or 7. I was also extremely concerned that adult males around me might try and hurt me, but again, was emberrased and ashamed of this, and never told anyone.

Again, idk if this is nothing, or something huge and really concerning, but I can't seem to stop worrying about it. So any thoughts or advise would be very much appreciated.",https://www.reddit.com/r/therapy/comments/lxc6c6/i_think_i_might_have_been_sexually_assaulted_as_a/,I think I might have been Sexually Assaulted as a child??,,53,20,0.95

I accepted a long time ago that my boyfriend was raised under this ""machismo"" culture and he's always had full control of his sexuality. Sex for him has always been fun. It's never been an act of torture or control or manipulation. And although he's been sympathetic of my pain and respectful of my boundaries he fundamentally doesn't get why it's still affecting me.

What he said last night hurt. He made some light jokes about sexual assault allegations in politics and I snapped back that he wasn't funny, and when he kept pushing it with ""You know I'm kidding, don't be mad"" I reminded him that *I've been sexually assaulted* and it's *not funny*.

That's when his honest feelings about my experience came out, after all this time trying to work on it and communicate through my issues with him, and he said ""That wasn't sexual assault. You never actually tried to get out or get away.""

I explained that anything sexual without consent is sexual assault, and that coerced consent isn't consent, and that I *did* try to get out when I changed the subject and told him I was scared. I didn't even bring up that he was referring to *one* time it happened, not the time I was literally locked in my ex's car or all the times I've suffered through unwanted consensual sex because I was conditioned to believe that it didn't matter if I said no.

I feel alone... I feel abandoned... yet again... was she trying to get rid of me by spacing out my sessions even more? Was it that email I sent some weeks ago. She seemed off ever since... I knew I shouldn't have sent that...

Maybe my feeling don't matter... she says I'm making progress but I don't feel it... is panicking at the slightest things progress? Is having to use all the energy you have to not slit your wrist progress?? Yes I had a good week in between... but what is a good week when you are second guessing every move you make? What is a good week when you feel like you can't survive on your own? What is a good week when every single thing feels hard... like even small tasks seem like such a drag while the world is speeding past you and you can't keep up.... what is a good week when you are so afraid of falling asleep without sleeping pills... pills that have been linked to Alzheimers disease if taken long term... thus adding to the worry... is there even a point to one good week... 

I am so done with all of this... I am so done with feeling anxious all of the time.... so done with having to work 10√ó harder to do things normal people barely have to put any effort for... I am so done not being able to form secure attachments to people... I am so done with living my life trying to fill this hole in my heart... knowing that nothing and noone can ever fix this... only me... but I cannot seem to fix it either...

i7n3mb,therapy,1597129501.0,"Hello all you happy therapy people, this is is me from a throwaway account. I‚Äôd like an unbiased opinion on my therapist‚Äôs evaluation. Long rant ahead.

I‚Äôve been seeing her since March for panic attacks and general anxiety. We have a good vibe and she‚Äôs brought a lot of good insight, however one thing bothers me: she keeps picking out and centering on my husband. Examples:

My parents were to arrive for a week‚Äôs stay on Sunday. I had said I‚Äôd get the curtains installed and hung up (which involved shortening them) and I‚Äôd been working on it bit by bit but it was fidgety work that I couldn‚Äôt get to look right, something was constantly off. Our kids were playing in the room next to where I was working, and my husband was downstairs cleaning. So I told her I had a meltdown because of something being always wrong with the bleeping curtains and the kids constantly coming into the room and nattering at me (as kids do). Her instant reaction was: ‚ÄúWhere was your husband? Why didn‚Äôt he take the kids off you?‚Äù I replied that I wasn‚Äôt playing with the kids, they were just coming in to see me because I was coincidentally in the room next door, while husband was downstairs cleaning, and if he was to stop cleaning to play with them I would have to both do the curtains and clean. Her reaction: ‚ÄúAnd why couldn‚Äôt he have taken the kids, done the curtains and the cleaning?‚Äù I was stunned for a second and replied ‚Äúbecause it‚Äôs not fair that he does everything and I do nothing‚Äù. To which she replied ‚Äúyou always defend him and make up excuses for him, you‚Äôre always trying to please him and you suffer.‚Äù

Now, to be clear, I‚Äôve had panic attacks since my early 20s (I‚Äôm 34 now). My anxiety was at its peak when I was 22-23, when I didn‚Äôt leave the house for weeks. Now I‚Äôm 34, have a husband and two kids, a good job, dream house, am independant. I drive (which I only learned at 29 and was a MASSIVE anxiety trigger which I overcame), I‚Äôve got friends, I‚Äôm working towards an MA on my free time, I get sh*t done. Of course I have more responsibilities now than then but that comes hand in hand with being an adult. My husband isn‚Äôt perfect, to be sure, but he‚Äôs not a horrible person. He works a lot and hard to make sure we can live comfortably, he is a loving and devoted father, if not the most hands-on one (but I often force him to be more hands-on, even if he complains!). He works full-time with extra hours on top, and cycling is his way to unwind, tours of 3-5 hours. He‚Äôs also not very in touch with his emotions, he‚Äôs extremely rational to the point of not caring about things that he rationally has classified as ‚Äúemotional problems that can‚Äôt be explained nor solved with logic‚Äù. This can be difficult to live with but I knew he was like this and I accept him even if his coolness drives me crazy sometimes. He‚Äôs also nitpicky and sees fault everywhere but in himself and is very vocal about it. However, he cares deeply, he just has different ways of expressing it - eg. he‚Äôll spend hours planning fun day trips when we‚Äôre on holiday, or he‚Äôll spend hours researching, buying and fitting the best solution for the floor in the playroom so that the kids don‚Äôt lose their Lego between the floorboards. Because he works full-time and I part-time I end up doing about 75-80% of stuff with the kids, I take them to parties and playdates and activities, I remember to fill up on nappies etc. He takes and picks up our older son to and from school. I cook, he mostly cleans. I think while we don‚Äôt divide everything 50/50 we have a fair division of labour. 

My therapist thinks otherwise. She keeps saying that he is what‚Äôs causing my anxiety. I keep telling her I had it long before I met him. She says I seem deeply unhappy because I don‚Äôt want to consider a divorce and that‚Äôs what‚Äôs triggering my panic attacks. I tell her I had panic attacks before I met him, that I CHOSE him and my life and that I‚Äôve never been happier, and that destroying a family over something so small seems deeply petty, selfish and unnecessary, not to mention it doesn‚Äôt solve the root problem because the anxiety will still be there. She says emotional validation isn‚Äôt a small thing. I say it‚Äôs only one thing in a bigger picture. And we go on like this in circles.

Ive thought about suicide several times before, and before i even joined, but this time i had felt so strongly about actually going through with it that i had to tell someone.
Always been a weird kid, but i was never diagnosed with any kind of mental illness or disorder. My parents didnt really believe in that kind of institutionalized emotional help, and as i said, i never wanted to talk to anyone about it. Id get regular feelings that i was alone, and that im a horrible person and i shouldnt exist.
During the op, i was sitting on a roadguard post for several hours doing nothing, which gave me too much time to think. A family member passed away very recently and i blamed myself for not visiting her when i had the chance. On top of that, i havent been able to perform very well at my job because i lack experience and physical ability and it just makes me hate myself more.

imiqxd,MentalHealthSupport,1599235673.0,"After a life-long battle with not going to therapy, I decided to take the first step to get better and today went to make an appointment with a psychologist at a local clinic (in the Dominican Republic, where I‚Äôm from).

I know there‚Äôs a lot of trauma I‚Äôve been carrying my entire life that need to be worked on so I‚Äôve made my mind that testing is needed to get clear information of how my experiences have affected me.

I‚Äôm 32 years old. At a point she asked ‚Äúwhy someone with that age doesn‚Äôt have a family or the desire to have one‚Äù. Besides explaining her that having offspring is not something I‚Äôve ever wanted, I brought up the fact that I‚Äôm openly gay (you can figure out what that means in a homophobic country).

To that, she asked me if I was molested when I was a child, explaining that ‚Äúthat‚Äôs the first thing that comes to mind¬†¬ª and then suggested that on top of the testing for personality disorders (which I‚Äôm doing tomorrow regardless if I‚Äôm facing a biased ¬´¬†professional¬†¬ª towards homosexuality, because I want to know) she suggested we could figure out if my homosexuality is ¬´¬†actually¬†¬ª my sexual orientation... saying that it could be ‚Äúa belief I‚Äôve just set in me‚Äù.

I told her that since I‚Äôm aware I always felt attracted to other boys, and even when in school I got to like two girls, at the same time I felt attracted to boys... the difference was that I could never be open about it. It was in college, when I was away from home that I came to peace with the fact that I like men and since then felt free and it hasn‚Äôt been a source of shame anymore. Up to now I identify as a gay man, but I‚Äôm aware that sexual orientation could be more of a spectrum rather than a binary.

To the if I was molested question, I told her that when I was 13 an adult far cousin exposed himself to me (he played porn on the TV and started to jack off), but at that age I was very aware of my attraction to men. If anything, he saw me as a vulnerable gay kid and took advantage of it.

Having said that, I‚Äôve felt arousal while watching girl on girl action and straight porn, but not so much as I do with gay porn. Also, I‚Äôve never had sex with a woman, but I say that before I die I want to try it out, for the curiosity (in a three way with a guy, for starters).

I‚Äôm adding this because I have questioned ‚ÄúAm I bi?‚Äù before, but then I see a penis and get the feels and also remember how I felt on the underwear aisle when I was a kid...

Like, if anything I might have bisexual tendencies, but men are on the top. I don‚Äôt see myself being with women beyond a night of curiosity...

So, am I facing a biased psychologist that is projecting her beliefs on me? She seemed religious, at various moments in the interview she mentioned how ‚ÄúGod has been by my side‚Äù... and even though I believe in God/Universe as a force, I‚Äôm not religious, but also think everyone is entitled to a belief, psychologists included.

Should I stick with her beyond the evaluation of tomorrow, or give her the benefit of the doubt and see if there‚Äôs more about my sexual orientation that I ignore?

I don‚Äôt want to seem judgmental, but she‚Äôs already an old lady... which gave me hopes because that should speak about how experienced she is in her field (am I sure about that? lol)... but now I‚Äôm wondering if she‚Äôs someone with outdated views on homosexuality and need to take the next exit available.

Any advice?

zsvtpu,MentalHealthSupport,1671740534.0,"As a creative person, I had always enjoyed expressing myself through art. However, I found myself feeling stuck and unfulfilled. Despite having a good job, a supportive family, and a boyfriend and friends, something was missing in my life. I had always been interested in art therapy, but I wasn't sure where to start.

One day, while scrolling through my social media feed, I came across a post about Creative XX Change, a monthly art exchange program that used art to address mental health issues. The concept immediately caught my attention and I decided to visit the website to learn more.

As I read through the information on the site, I was touched by the stories of others who had found healing and transformation through art. I realized that this was exactly what I had been looking for. I wanted to find a way to express myself, relax, and find stress relief, and I believed that art could be the key.

So I took a leap of faith and signed up for Creative XX Change. Each month, I was paired with a new anonymous pen-pal and received art activities to complete and exchange with them. These activities were designed to help promote emotional, psychological, and social well-being and provide a way for people to express themselves and find stress relief.

As I worked on these activities I felt spiritually connected with my pen-pals, I began to feel a sense of healing and transformation. The anonymous nature of the program provided a safe and welcoming space for me to share my thoughts and feelings without fear of judgment. I found the art activities to be therapeutic and loved the opportunity to connect with someone through the creative process.

I am so grateful to have discovered Creative XX Change and the positive impact it has had on my mental health and well-being. I continue to participate in the program and encourage others to give it a try as well. I believe that the creative arts can be a powerful tool for healing and personal growth, and I am grateful to have found a way to incorporate them into my life.

Ok, here goes.

Always wanted to talk about this in my real life, face to face, but I'm scared to do so, hence why I am here.  


So  I have been struggling with this for quite some time, about 15 years  now. I am still living at home with my mom, step-father passed a few  years ago, so I am very close to the former. Got a few best friends in  my life, however I have never discussed this with them as I am afraid of  how they will react. It started when I was in my teenage years and  continued from there. When I was around 13, 14 I developed a minor  attraction to children. At the beginning I didn't think much of it,  thinking it would go away, but as the years went by, these urges became  much more. I initially repressed the feelings and asked god to take  away, and I thought he had. When I grew older, the people I was  attracted to stayed the same age. I always wanted to find a group for  support, but there aren't any, and I can understand why. We are the most  hated in all of society. I have never acted upon my attraction, nor  will I ever. And I have never done anything illegal and don't plan to.  Am I a peadophile? I obey the laws and respect and agree with society's  position on it, and those sort of people. I was meant to go to a  therapist about this, but in the end I backed out and never went due to  the fear of being reported. Is there any way for this to go away? I am  not afraid of commiting any crime, as I have controlled myself for so  long. I consider myself a good Christian, and regulary go to church. Why  is this happening to me? If there is hate replies, I understand why. Is  there any type of counseling that one can go to where I remain  anonymous, and I can get treated for this mental disorder?",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthSupport/comments/izlah4/am_i_a_pedophile/,Am I a pedophile?,,29,15,0.95

You are VALID and you are VALUABLE! Do not let yourself be defined by your diagnosis. You are more than just a collection of the things that are ""wrong"" with you. You are a person, and you are who you are in spite of these things, not because of them. Never let anyone belittle you because of your struggles. You are STRONGER than the people who ""grit their teeth and bear it"" because they have not had to jump the same hurdles as you to get where you are. 

It is NEVER shameful or weak to ask for help. Anyone who tells you otherwise has forgotten that they once had to be spoon fed as a child or has forgotten how many times they've had to ask their grandchildren to fix their computer. 

Stay the path. It may be long, it may come with unexpected turns, but eventually there is light at the end.

Still, small things that would make a normal person frown but nothing more make me loose it. I get annoyed with my girlfriend for the most meaningless shit.

I am at work right now, and as I was flipping through to find a blank piece of paper... I came across the start of one of my suicide letters. I've been finding them recently as I have been getting my life on track. In my spare time, when I was extremely depressed I use to write letters to friends and family so that in case I just did it without notice there would be a letter for everyone. Reading them, it feels like I am reading someone else's words. 

This one read: 

My name is\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ 

I've been in pain for a while... before you blame yourself:

1. This was my fault 
2. You all did everything you could 
3. I loved everyone, I just couldn't feel your love (Again, my fault). 

I felt like crying as soon as I read it. This time last year I was in a really dark place. I was reliant on alcohol and cigarettes to get me through the day and to go to bed at night. I spent a lot of time by myself though when I was around people I acted like I was perfectly fine. In reality, I was dying inside. I went to go meet with my dietician in December right before Christmas. When we saw that I had gained weight we talked I told her what was happening and she went into beast mode to get me to a doctor for help that day. That day I was put on anti-depressants and made an appointment with a therapist. In January, I was seeing a doctor every week (I called them my suicide watch appointments) until I could meet with a therapist. I started on 10mg of Lexapro and then I was put on 25mg then 50mg and now 100mg of Zoloft. I am coming up on 1 year clean of self-harm. I can't believe it has already been a year. It has been one hell of a journey. I had my good moments when I was younger and thought that I was all better, but soon after I was depressed again. I've been in a good mental place now for 6 months. It is not easy. I've learned to celebrate the good things and to work towards getting better as well as being more selective about who I am around. I've learned how to reprioritize things in my life and I have never been happier. I was able to survive because of my doctor, dietician, therapist, pastors, and friends in my life! I couldn't do it alone. I called the suicide hotline so many times because a small part of me wanted to live and keep going. I am glad I did. I felt like this needed to be shared.

11xogyy,MentalHealthSupport,1679420916.0,"This is a PSA/rant on learning about your mental health issues and getting a proper diagnosis.

I, like many of you, have suffered silently for many years before seeking out professional help and being diagnosed. In my case, it has taken just over a decade and for many others, undoubtedly much longer than that. For me, the reason was a mix of all or at least the overwhelming majority of my family and friends (whom I, eventually, after many years opened up to or seek help from) not accepting or believing my problems and/or not knowing how to help me. Not to say there haven't been people who have helped me immensely, but hear me out...

This lack of help, knowledge and skills, lead me to do my research on mental health issues and eventually come to find specific issues which I felt were very close to what I have been dealing with day-to-day. It is my understanding that mental health issues often lead to developing other mental health issues, and that there is usually a large overlap of symptoms between a lot of these issues.

In my search, I often came across the advice to not self-diagnose, and while I think it is wise to be doubtful of my judgement knowing that I am not a trained professional, I also disagree with what I felt was usually implied by the above advice, which is to assume that you are probably wrong until you are properly diagnosed by a professional.

I know that for some, it can become a problem. It's easy to look up the symptoms of the probably thousands of known mental health illnesses and with how many symptoms overlap, it is no doubt easy to mistakenly diagnose issues incorrectly and to go down that rabbit hole.

But I also know that it has been quite helpful for me to learn about different mental health issues and to come across issues that I was later diagnosed with.

I think knowing what my issues were (in my opinion) most likely to be helped me in a lot of different ways.

For one, mental health struggles can make you feel extremely lonely and alone and knowing what I might suffer from helped me feel a little more accepted and less like I was the only one and like I was making it all up, something that's been a huge doubt for me ever since I came to learn that I had mental health issues years ago.

Secondly, I was able to learn from the many great online resources that are available and to find out about things that have helped others in a similar situation to me and how to better deal with my problems.

Something else that doing my research helped me with later on was accepting that I had lots of mental issues and that they are quite severe. I know that if my research hadn't prepared me for that, I would have had a much harder time accepting that.

In conclusion, I think that while you obviously should not take your guesses as a professional diagnosis, it's perfectly ok to do your research and to bring yourself some comfort and a sense of acceptance by learning more about the issues that you suspect you may have.

I'm not sure if I was quite able to put my thoughts into words here, but I had some advice that I wish I could've given my younger self and that is not to be scared to learn about what you think your problems could be if you find that helpful and I thought that maybe someone out there will be able to take my advice and benefit from it.

If you read through my rant, I hope it was of some help, and I wish you health and happiness.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthSupport/comments/11xogyy/psarant_research_vs_selfdiagnosis/,[PSA/Rant] Research vs self-diagnosis,,22,4,0.93

My Sister the legend

Many people survive cancer or MS, or a terminal severe traumatic brain injury, something physical and life changing. Everyone rallies around. Schizophrenia in a healthy young teen demonstrates people avoid, rather than support you

My beautiful, gifted and intelligent sister has survived with a scary trauma induced psychiatric episode age 19 after high school (no drugs no alcohol, it was child traumatic psychiatric PTSD) where she got psychosis and schizophrenia as a previously healthy normal young woman, she was a straight A student, no troubles ever. We are like twins, a year apart

This is my purple star to my beautiful sister who never ever gets credit for her pushing on without much support, was bullied badly in high school and at home, despite her illness. She has never ever received admiration or support from anyone but me not even family to say ‚Äúyou‚Äôre a survivor‚Äù but I am so damn proud of her; she turns up with a smile every day to see me no matter what, who never gets credit for her survival story when others who get credit for their brain tumours out or chemo have more support than she does, she does it quietly and pretty much solo (socially) not many understand. Even if she had a few hundred strangers online write nice words it would bring a tear to her eye that at least some people might care in this world

My sister is so amazing; she shows me love I never thought possible. She has all her troubles but never fails to support me, I have spine damage and pain and she is always there for me and she makes me laugh, she never lets me down ever. And even though I wish she was married with kids I appreciate that without that is less pressure on her right now

I wish a guy could see all that I see and not what she lacks. I wish we could all see the potential I see in others even with psychosis or mental illness; she is literally so damn intelligent and a beautiful soul; we joke she is the savant from Rain Man, she has so much to offer to world. On medication she is stable but unfortunately It‚Äôs challenging for her to finish work or study, she could do vet science but has not been able to finish. She used to be top of her class in high school but I try to get her to focus on her achievements that aren‚Äôt the same as her. Peers. I say she has a PhD in traumatic brain levels and psychological stress.

I wish we could support those with mental health issues more so they are seen more as a person or someone with potential, and not someone less of a person or less worthy like society makes them feel. They need more support than a cancer patient who has their mind still (both our parents survived lymphoma and a brain tumour and that was less intense.)

For anyone reading this with family or who has a mental illness; you are loved and appreciated for your struggles. My sister is worth more than her weight in diamonds and gold for surviving in this cruel world with psychosis, where men make fun of her for being different and I am the one that defends her until the death.

igsu7v,MentalHealthSupport,1598418669.0,"Today, I passed my calculus mid-term. After weeks of pre-emptitive  study, I thought that I may be happy after I passed. I was relieved for about 30 minutes. Not happy, just relieved and then I went back into feeling just sad and hopeless.

   I used to have many hobbies that I could find consistent enjoyment out of but now it takes considerable effort to just bring myself to start them and is tedious to continue.

 I don't feel like doing anything but doing nothing feels like a waste of the very little time I have, as a human. This creates a perpetual cycle of sadness or guilt as I am either doing something and forcing myself through it or not doing anything and feeling guilty for wasting time. 

I hate going to bed because then I am inundated with negative thoughts and dread about my future. I try to divert my thoughts but it takes active effort to do so and the effort makes it impossible for me to sleep because the mental exertion keeps me awake. I also hate waking up because I need to stop dreaming and live life. I would rather live in the fantasy of my dreams because, while they aren't happy, they at least aren't melancholic and miserable like reality. I also don't have anything to look forward to wake up to. Yes, I have a job, am in uni and have daily chores but none of those are things that I WANT to wake up to. They are things I must do to continue living functionally. I'm not trying to focus on the negative either. I will often tell myself ""It's a new day. The entire day is open. What do I want to do?"" but this leads to disappointment as I realize there is nothing I actually want to do. 

It feels like all the happiness has been eroded away. The only time I feel happy is when I'm with my sister but she is in a different uni so we don't see each other often. I feel lonely which causes me to think that finding friends or a girlfriend would fix that but I realize that the loneliness isn't something that is fixed by adding people to your life. I need to address the underlying issue that I don't yet understand. 

I want to see a therapist but uni currently keeps me living at the bare minimum to not incur debt. 

I wish I knew why I no longer feel happiness but all my efforts of introspection haven't lead to anything conclusive. Life just feels like a continuous daze that feels miserable to wade through but it feels like there is no other option. Suicide certainly is not an option because I care too much about those I love to hurt them by doing that. Unfortunately, I can't say for certain if it wouldn't be an option if it wouldn't hurt anyone else. The main reason that I am firmly against the option is because I love others and don't want to hurt them, nothing to do with me, personally.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthSupport/comments/igsu7v/i_feel_like_im_living_for_the_sake_of_not_dying/,I feel like I'm living for the sake of not dying.,,22,10,0.94

It‚Äôs impossible to function in a society with a mindset like this so I stop thinking and live life on autopilot, not thinking deeply about any of my actions or words. Over the years, this has led me to become a useless, spineless slug that I am now. I am 16 now, but have emotional development of a 10 year old and can‚Äôt think for myself in any slightly challenging situation.
What I described above is my theory on why i am like I am right now - all kids of my age I know are filled with ambition and enthusiasm, while I can‚Äôt come up with an answer when someone asks me what I like to do in my free time. I have no personal interests and do things just because others do them. I still believe that it‚Äôs not too late and it‚Äôs possible for me to get my shit together, but right now I find it hard to imagine myself happy anytime soon. 
I‚Äôm sorry that this description is not easily readable, this is just my stream of thoughts projected onto a Reddit post. If you‚Äôve had similar experiences, please help me.

Not only did he royally screw up major details about my visits (like he phoned it in and wasn't even listening!) But all my other therapists would write things like

Appearance: well groomed, appropriately dressed.

This new therapist did that for a couple visits. I struggle with eating disorders (fear of food, days without eating) and he'd write 

Appearance: overweight. 


That's it. Overweight. I went to my normal doctor who is telling me I can't afford to lose weight due to my eating disorders. But my therapist stopped commenting on Appearance that indicates where my mental health is at, and simply writes ""overweight"". Mind you, I am not overweight.  My shirt size is medium, and I have broad shoulders but I'm in no way obese.

Short version of the above: Fiance got hospitalized for severe mania with psychosis that resulted in him pushing me over (just bruised, no severe damage) due to losing his job, our upcoming wedding, COVID, everything happening in the world right now. Thought he had bipolar and he has been hospitalized for depression before, worried that he never treated it, but he had never been manic in the 3 years I've been with him. Wedding is off since he can't consent right now. Parents are shocked but supportive. He had been on the phone with them when the cops came and he forgot and left it on, so they heard exactly how crazy he sounded, how he was screaming, and how I just tried to help. Got great comments from my first post here about LEAP and other resources, if he is ready to accept help.

Today is his 7th day, and I am really, really struggling. I called a therapist for myself today and got squeezed in for an appt, either tomorrow or the next day. My fiance was committed 4 days ago and is now showing COVID symptoms, and he laid on the guilt yesterday about how I exposed him to COVID. I so, so hope that he is negative and those are just medication side effects. He is high-risk, and if he got severely sick from this, or goodness forbid passed away, I don't know how I would pick up the pieces and not feel guilt. But I also know that he went in because he wasn't safe and I had no choice. His parents and I debated when I had to drive away from the house if there was anything we could do but get him to the hospital in the middle of a pandemic, and we knew there wasn't.

But I am also struggling because he is still showing so little remorse. Yesterday night around 9 pm his roommate called me and said my fiance had given him my name, address and phone number, and he was being released and wanted to come by my house. He asked me when I go to sleep, because he might swing by at midnight... Needless to say, I was terrified and called the hospital and burst into tears and said I thought I was in danger. The hospital security staff thankfully took it seriously and told me that this person was not in fact released, so I don't need to worry today or the rest of this week. However I have no idea when he will be released or if he is still planning to swing by for a visit when he is. Am I in danger next week? Do they have to tell me if he is released later? What if my fiance is still very sick then, and I am still alone in this house?

In addition, my fiance, in a fit of anger, claimed on Friday that I was filing a restraining order and revoked my access to his records, so I have no idea how his COVID symptoms are for the past 36 hours or if he is taking any more treatment. I haven't been able to talk to his therapist about him or get her advice on how to talk to him since Friday, since he will occasionally call me (and only me). I have no idea what I should say when he calls. He called briefly today to apologize and said he realized what he did with his roommate in sharing my information ""looks bad""... but after about a minute or so of seeming remorseful he said he still thought I ""should have trusted him."" I was glad for the apology, that means a lot and it's progress, but in his core he is still painting everything as my fault, including him pushing me down last week and him being in the hospital at all.  

This is exhausting. I just can't deal with talking to him right now, it leaves me shaking, but all I want is to hear him come back to who he was. He is so cold, so angry, and I do not recognize him. There is so little sorrow for what he has done to me, just anger that I don't trust him and a vow that he will never trust me again. It is everyone's fault but his, and I cannot get behind that. 

But I go back and forth, because I know this is his burden to accept, not mine, and I need to step back and let the professionals work. If he doesn't accept that what he did is wrong, I have to walk away, despite having a beautiful life together and so much hope for our future before this struck. But I'm not there yet. He has only been on the right meds for a few days, and this isn't the real him talking. I know he's scared, and I would be too. I know he's terrified of COVID and he hates being locked in his room (now with no roommates), but these are the consequences of his actions, and of his refusing to accept help weeks ago when he admitted he was manic and I told him I was worried he wasn't sleeping, and of his escalating in the hospital such that he had to be committed involuntarily. I offer encouragement as best I can with no guidance when he calls, so I'm doing my best. I have to be kind to myself here, put up boundaries and take care of myself first.

Because the pain and fear he is causing me and his parents is very real even though he is not himself. I look out the window after almost every car, for fear that the hospital had the records wrong and this guy is going to suddenly pull into my driveway. I don't know his name or have his phone number and so I have no guarantee he wouldn't simply arrive here. I struggle to eat since everything tastes like nothing, and I have lost weight already, but I do eat as best I can. I know these are the classic signs of hypervigilance and trauma, and I am in touch with my psychiatrist every day. I am glad I have my therapy appt so soon.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthSupport/comments/ixx6li/update_my_fiance_is_in_the_hospital_for_a/,"[UPDATE] My fiance is in the hospital for a psychotic break, two weeks before our wedding",,21,9,0.96
icpgdw,MentalHealthSupport,1597849805.0,"Since taking shrooms I have had no feeling but depression and anxiety, my brain always feels foggy, have trouble concentrating, I feel dumb. I really need help and have no idea how to get better.

To start from the beginning I went away for college and started smoking a lot of weed. One day my buddy from back home messages me and says that he wants to do shrooms. I really didn't want to do it at first but after I looked more into it I thought it could maybe help with my social anxiety and maybe get me to stop smoking. So a couple weeks later I go back home for a 3 day weekend and decided to take them. There was 3 of us that needed up doing them. We all took a couple but my buddies got high within 30 minutes, while I still didn't feel anything. I went and had a few more caps, but after an hour and a half all I felt was like a weed body high, so I went and took few more. While I'm doing this my buddies are outside talking about random shit while I'm inside by myself trying to get on their level. About an hour later I was really high but I didn't see anything it was just a body high. I thought they just hadn't kicked in yet but after a little bit I still didn't see anything, at that point I just accepted it. I then though maybe because I was smoking so much weed and my tolence from that was really high, maybe it affected how high I got from shrooms. I then went outside with my buddies and just felt I didn't belong. They were tripping pretty hard and seeing crazy shit, while I'm thinking how much I hate myself for being addicted to weed. We all ended up going back inside, one buddy went upstairs to do his own thing and me and the other guy sat on the couch watching TV. I felt absolutely horrible and depressed. I just wanted to sit there and talk to my friend and just cry it out, but I was so anxious that it just never came out. I ended up just waiting out the high and fell asleep. When I woke back up I still felt some effects but I just drained. I went home took a 3 hour nap and then drove back to school, which was a terrible idea because of the state I was in. I felt so out of it and depressed and sad that I cried the first 2 hours of my drive. 

The next 2 weeks were just awful. Every night I'd get really depressed and cry for a couple hours just cause I didn't feel like me, didn't feel any emotions but sadness. The only thing I found would keep me together and feeling somewhat normal was weed. I ended up dropping out of college a month later because I had no motivation to do anything. Since then it's been a little over a year and I still feel the same way. I don't get any feelings when I go to family events or pet my dog. It like my emotions went away and my brain just auto responds to everything. I have no interest in anything at all and have a lot of trouble just making conversation, it's like I just don't know what to say. My memory is also really bad and have trouble learning things. I also find that my mind is blank a lot, I'm just staring into space.I feel utter despair at times in having to live in this awful state, and yet I also don‚Äôt care at the same time.

I tried going to a therapist for a couple months but after a few sessions I didn't have anything to say anymore and ended up leaving. I have also tried taking depression and anxiety medicine but I feel like they just don't do anything. I've looked into this before and some people have said to take shrooms again in the right environment and having a good trip will make it better but I really didn't enjoy taking them. So if prefer not to.

I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs cute that they cry all night. 

I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs cute that my daughter shits all over the house. Literally. She had shit in 6 different outfits. She refuses to use he toilet.

I just feel like I should have stayed child free but I didn‚Äôt and now I‚Äôve successfully fucked my entire life. I think if I just left now they would be better off.

Edit- I‚Äôm going to just update instead of replying individually. I‚Äôve seeked out a therapist, which is a whole other world of anxiety for me. I saw one recently but she rescheduled both appointments multiple times, once was 10 minutes AFTER my appointment was supposed to begin. 

I go through phases where I‚Äôm okay and I just roll with it, but I don‚Äôt handle adversity well. I beat myself up over the smallest shit and idk how to stop. For instance, I‚Äôve been potty training my daughter for over a year at this point and it‚Äôs just not happening. I‚Äôm used to having a job and doing well. There is no ‚Äúwinning‚Äù at parenting. If I successfully do one thing, then another thing implodes. It‚Äôs exhausting.

Outings are better for us because they are busy and it wears them out but the thought of leaving the house everyday stresses me out. I also hate going places alone but I‚Äôve recently found a moms group that I‚Äôll join for outings. Most of the women are great, every now and then you get the perfectly polished mom who can‚Äôt relate on the ‚Äúim going to lose my shit‚Äù aspect, but good for her, I wish I kept it together that well. Oh, and this cold ass weather puts a damper on everything. The process of getting children dressed and in the car is so much more complicated  when it‚Äôs cold! 

At the end of the day, I‚Äôm just a person that requires down time to recharge and that part of life is over and it‚Äôs not my kids fault. They didn‚Äôt ask to be here. Some people like to keep themselves busy, some people need creative release, I need time to unwind.

Not in a body image sort of way, in the way that an anxiety attack makes you want to exit a situation. Except, the situation is myself? I‚Äôve experienced anxiety throughout most of my life, but this is very different.

The feelings are paired with extreme irritation. My own thoughts and feelings make me so unbelievably frustrated that I‚Äôm literally fighting urges to tear my skin off or rip my hair out. It‚Äôs like standing in a room with someone who won‚Äôt shut up but not being able to leave because the person is me.

I feel disconnected from myself and trapped in my own body and mind, I really want to exit my body, and like have a break from being around myself in the way you would a really draining relationship.

I experienced these extreme feelings for a few solid weeks when I was about 13 (I‚Äôm 16 now). It doesn‚Äôt sound like that long, but I promise it was exhausting and dehumanising.

It feels like my skin and body is something that I need to remove to be free... If that makes sense without sounding insane. I don‚Äôt want to get like I was at 13 again.

I‚Äôve been told the mental health support that I have access to to research these feelings, which is difficult. When I search things to do with escaping my body I can never find anything that relates to my feelings, instead I get things to do with body image and anxiety. So, I‚Äôm wondering if anyone here has had similar experiences or knows what these feelings mean, I‚Äôm pretty desperate and it‚Äôd be really helpful! :)",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthSupport/comments/cf5y4i/feeling_like_i_need_to_escape_from_my_body/,Feeling like I need to escape from my body?,,21,16,0.97

lmbx66,MentalHealthSupport,1613616770.0,"List of Distractions

*So this is a list of distractions for when I‚Äôm feeling upset and/or overwhelmed, I made this for myself but will post to communities in case someone else finds them helpful. Many are from the DBT workbook but quite a few are my own ideas, too. Stay safe lovelies*,üíï  

##My Distraction Plan  
1. Use R.E.S.T.  
2. Splash cold water on my face.¬† 
3. Text someone I love (even just ‚ÄúI love you/hope you‚Äôre having a good day ttyl‚Äù)  
4. Exercise - go for a run or do rowing, work up a sweat and get rid of suppressed energy and tension.¬† 
5. Shower.  
6. Listen to ASMR  
7. Take a few moments to distract myself with thoughts, calming and imaginative.  
8. Check down list of other self-care distractions, freshen up and feel good about myself.  
9. Get something accomplished by doing some chores and tidying up.  
10. Do something enjoyable, listen to music and float away on the lyrics.  

##Distract your Thoughts  

* Imagine something amazing happening, like you stumble upon a portal to another world. Will you go through, and what will you bring with you?¬†¬†

* Think about someone you love / care about, and decide on something kind you can say or do for them. Give them a hug or text them (or imagine how lovely it will feel to hug them again).  

* Think about sex, with a partner or even just a crush or a celebrity you find attractive.¬†¬†

* Think of something you can do on your next day off, something fun like a new project or restaurant you‚Äôve been curious to try.¬†¬†

* Remind yourself that whatever you‚Äôre worried about will come to pass (as all things to), and think about how relieved you‚Äôll feel then, not how worried you are now.¬†¬†

* Imagine you‚Äôre disguised as someone on a secret operative - stay focused on not blowing your cover!¬†¬†

* Focus on the natural world around you, plants or animals, or the sky, even if it‚Äôs just looking out the window.¬†¬†¬†

* Imagine yourself as a superhero (or antihero), would you have an outfit, and what advantages or powers would you have?¬†¬†

* Think about a specific animal and how they experience the world - a deer gracefully walking through a forest, or a curious octopus exploring the ocean floor.¬† 

* Imagine yourself having a positive interaction with someone whose opinion matters to you. What do they say, are they praising you and if so why?¬†¬†

* Take deep breaths and do breathing exercises. Close your eyes. Meditate if you know how, or learn how to.¬†¬†

* Remember past events that were fun and exciting, and try to recall as many details about those moments as you can.¬†¬†

* Listen to music or a podcast, or think about one you like or listened to recently.¬†¬†

* See if you can recall all lyrics to your favourite songs and sing them in your head.¬† 

* Dance, practice some moves or even just be silly about it.¬†¬† 

##Distract yourself with Chores  

* Throw out any trash that‚Äôs cluttering surfaces, empty garbage/recycle, clean the bins if they‚Äôre dirty.¬†¬†

* Clean dishes and dry/put them away.  

* Dust all surfaces with a microfibre cloth, and wipe them clean if stained.¬†¬†

* Do laundry (including bedding and throw blankets).¬†¬†

* Clothing and accessories all put away properly (coat in closet not on the back of a chair).¬†¬†

* Sweep the floors and vacuum, washed if necessary.¬†¬†

* Clean the bathroom (change shower curtain liner).¬†¬†

* Wash windows and windowsills.¬†¬†

* Open windows to let fresh air in, and/or spray the window curtains and furniture with freshener.¬†¬†

##Distract yourself with Self-Care  
**Grooming**

* Shower, shave, lotion face for hydration and lotion up body with a nice scent.¬†¬†

* Trim and buff nails, get properly dressed.¬†¬†

* Book a haircut and eyebrow wax if you‚Äôre overdue for one.¬†¬†

* Buy some new clothing items, including new socks and underclothes.¬†¬†

* Replenish any hygiene items *before* they run out.¬†¬†

**Body**

* Exercise - if you don‚Äôt have a routine then draft one that includes cardio, strength and core exercises.¬†¬†

* Go for a walk (weather permitting).¬†¬†

* Stay hydrated, keep a bottle of water nearby and limit other beverages to tea/coffee.¬†¬†¬†¬†

* Get attention from a partner (or) rub one out yourself.¬†¬†

* Meal plan for the day or week, make a list to pick up anything you‚Äôll need to buy and set out any freezer items for defrosting the day before.¬†¬†¬†¬†

* Dance - it will get your heart rate up and make you feel better.¬†¬†

* Did you take a multivitamin today?¬†¬†

##Distract yourself with Pleasurable Activities
* Listen to music (read lyrics)

jo2388,MentalHealthSupport,1604514753.0,"Given everything that‚Äôs happening in the world I thought I‚Äôd share my list of easy to use and easy to access mental health resources. Please feel free to add others you find particularly useful.

This isn‚Äôt a list of charities, organisations or support groups. I think it‚Äôs relatively easy to find the phone numbers for various helplines relating to mental health should you need them. Instead, I wanted to list some of the resources I‚Äôve used to help me manage my mental health over this turbulent year and maintain good psychological hygiene.

There‚Äôs so many resources, worksheets, portals and websites about mental health online that it can be a bit overwhelming. I‚Äôve tried so many different resources over the last year and I still feel like I‚Äôve seen only a tiny fraction.

That said, here are some I feel are the easiest to use and most helpful. I‚Äôm a bit biased towards cognitive behavioral therapy approaches so this may be less relevant if that isn‚Äôt your preference. I also find the Calm app helpful but didn‚Äôt include it in the list since you need to pay to access the main benefit.

Without further ado:

[Mood Self Assessment](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/stress-anxiety-depression/mood-self-assessment/)\- This questionnaire is really good at gauging roughly where you‚Äôre at and then pointing you to helpful resources based on your answers.

[Catch it](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/csd/app-directory/catch-it/) \- A simple free mood tracker and diary app based on cognitive behavioral therapy principles. It doesn‚Äôt try to overcomplicate anything. Especially helpful for recording anxious thoughts.

[Cove](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/cove-music-for-mental-health/id1020256581) \- Helps you express emotions through music. It‚Äôs like a music mood diary. Sounds quite unusual but is helpful to people who struggle to express themselves. Still needs work but cool idea.

[Iona](http://get-iona.web.app/) \- App that walks you through cognitive behavioural therapy and mindfulness exercises. Much more engaging than reading articles or worksheets and easy to use.

[Mind](https://www.mind.org.uk/) \- A great aggregator and portal of mental health resources. One of the most helpful features is it lets you select what you need help with and it directs you to useful resources.

[What‚Äôs Up](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/whats-up-a-mental-health-app/id968251160) \- This is a good one stop shop if you‚Äôre looking for something to give you immediate relief. It certainly puts substance over style but provides clear and helpful information.

[Mind Shift](https://www.anxietycanada.com/resources/mindshift-cognitive%20behavioural%20therapy%20/) \- Free app based on cognitive behavioural therapy with user friendly design.

ihacft,MentalHealthSupport,1598485780.0,"I need help and i don't know where to go. All i think about is how worthless i am to my friends and how they're better off without me. I keep thinking that i'm easy to forget and i don't make any positive impact on them even though if they tell me otherwise.

I have insecurity issues with my bf who has been nothing but honest and upfront with me. I feel insecure towards his longterm ex who he was considering marriage with. Despite his reassurances that he is over his ex and wants nothing to do with her in his life, i keep thinking that she was a lot more better gf than i could ever be to him and that he could never love me.

I don't have the financial stability to afford seeking mental help, and i come from a family who thinks mental illness is all but a myth and doesn't need recognition or professional help. I feel so insecure about myself that sometimes i feel like i'm better off dead. I have random bouts of crying, i lie in bed all day from lack of energy or just because i'm overwhelmed with all these negative thoughts and emotions, and i can barely sleep at night. Alcohol doesn't even help me like it used to, and instead just fuels my anxieties.

So far i've been turning to reddit for help with struggles i've been going through latelg I'd appreciate all the advice and help again :(

Edit: i've come to figure out as much from other reddit posts and help from friends: that my insecurities come from a strict asian parent who never really showed support or recognition for accomplishments, and also from an abusive past relationship.

So naturally, his death hit me hard. This happened in an Islamic country. I also come from a family that doesn‚Äôt really believe in depression or the need to open up emotionally. I was extremely lost and confused after I lost him and I had no friends to talk to ( I was not allowed to have close friends because they could be bad influence). So when I was 13, I found those group chats that people used to go on and started talking to stranger about how sad I am that I lost my grandpa. No one really wanted to listen to that. They wanted naked pictures of me. Eventually, I found one person who listened to what I had to say and became my friend. He was 25-26. 
I wanted a platonic relationship with him. Just someone to talk to about my day. Someone to replace my grandpa. But he brainwashed me to think no one loves me. That my parents hate me. (My father was living in the US so it was easy for me to believe him and my family doesn‚Äôt say ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù that much). He eventually persuaded me to send him naked pictures of myself by threatening me that he will never talk to me again. I was crying on the phone. I was begging him to let me just be friends with him and he finally convinced me that it wasn‚Äôt that bad and he knows more than me. 
After he had pictures of me, he threatened me with pictures. He said he‚Äôll expose them at my moms workplace and will get her fired. That‚Äôs how he convinced me a few month later to have sex with him. 
He lived 8 hours away. I only saw him in person once. I was crying and and begging him to see if he would change his mind. But he took my virginity and sodomized me. After that, he took my box of eraser collections and left. 
After that, I did not want to talk to him anymore. But he was threatening me more. 
I finally moved to the US and once I knew my mom was also moving I was not scared of him. I stopped talking to him. It was very difficult due to non stop calls, emails, and texts, but I did it. 
I have been feeling ashamed, guilty, embarrassed, and sexually unavailable for 7-8 years now.  
The only person I told in my family is my sister. Once she told my mom she told her that was my fault because I put myself in that Situation.

i am curled up in bed right now and i feel so alone. i feel so embarrassed and so selfish. i have been extremely depressed all year and i don‚Äôt see it getting any better but i‚Äôm trying so hard to hold my head up. i miss my friend so much. i‚Äôll have dreams about her and i wake up crying. i still don‚Äôt know why she left me. i just want her back. 

should i suck it up and try to reach out to one of my other friends myself? let them know i‚Äôm alright? do they maybe think i‚Äôm dead or that there‚Äôs just nothing they can do? does it matter? thank y‚Äôall muchly in advance, have a very good night",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthSupport/comments/youblh/no_one_has_reached_out_to_me_since_my_suicide/,no one has reached out to me since my suicide attempt. i feel so alone.

l0itce,MentalHealthSupport,1611058976.0,"Crying for Stress Relief and Healing

One way to survive a precarious roller coaster ride is to let it out - scream, laugh or cry ‚Äì while still being kind to those around us.  You may need a good old-fashioned cry, a method of self-soothing.  While perceptions of crying tend to be culture-specific, in Western cultures crying is often viewed as a stress relief.  

Crying is an area that continues to draw considerable attention from counselors in the client-therapist relationship.  While there have been mixed results in crying studies, after having a good deep cry, you‚Äôll more than likely feel like a weight has been lifted.  In fact, there are those in healing professions that have coined the term ‚Äúcrying that heals‚Äù (CTH)  to describe the potential benefits of crying.

Conversely, there may be consequences to the avoidance of crying, including potentially having more challenges emotionally connecting with others.  Those consequences can also include our bodies feeling the effects of holding in stress, including in the mouth and jaw.  Perhaps you‚Äôve been clenching your teeth or feeling tightness in your shoulders or back lately.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthSupport/comments/l0itce/just_a_reminder_its_okay_to_cry/,Just a reminder: It's okay to cry,,20,3,1.0

i6ibuu,MentalHealthSupport,1596975127.0,"I feel like this is never gonna end.
I'm so done at this point, it's not funny anymore.
I suffer from complex post-traumatic stress disorder aka c-ptsd.
I'm extremely cautious with people, I repress emotions without thinking about it, have a multitude of the strangest triggers (like a certain shade of yellow I.e.)
and I'm just generally quite unstable, not that anyone takes it seriously because I'm just too fricken polite to be an ass about it.

I might sound a little wierd with this but, I hate making people uncomftable. 
I'm communicative but  generally very careful to make sure no one worries about me.
That's definitely leftover from being bullied and growing up in a turbulent family to say the least.

I was hit with an intense flashback that induced a panicattack yesterday and took my emergency anti-psychotic meds - I took more then usual (still in the safety margin) and it basically made me super tired, bleary, quiet and slow which my family noticed.
I hated that so much, I explained it and everyone was  sympathetic, but the whole day I just wanted to be normal again.
That night I cried because I knew that no matter what I did, there's a slim chance I'll ever forget about the awful things that I had to live through.

I've been struggling for days with thoughts of suicide again (something I thought was  over, I was doing fine the last few weeks) because - my memories just haunt me, there's times where I feel like I can't even breathe or move, I'll be fine but then  hour later I'll be hysterically crying.
I'm in therapy but I feel like the amount of trauma I have, personally is just critical mass.
Everyday I just feel like I'm dragging something out that isn't worth it.
I'm tired, I'm hurting and I've tried everything to fix it.

I know that the people that love me want me to keep going, and I want to keep going for them but I'm just at my limits.
My quality of life has hit a low point a long time ago.

This will kill me at some point.
I just feel like, whenever I tell people I've had enough and I wanna die the responses are threefold:

_""you don't mean that""_

I'm sorry, but I do - If a doctor told me he could put me down I would be on a chair waiting in a second.

_""you just need to give it time and talk to someone""_

I've been doing that since I knew I could. It soothes but it doesn't heal.

_""you should try to apprechiate life more""_ 

I do, I apprechiate life so much that I've come atleast this far, I don't hate the world or the people around me. I think this world is beautiful and while I might sound hypocritical I encourage anyone I meet to do better and be kind, I see potential in them and humanity at large.
I'm too sensitive, I feel too deep and too intensely.
I'm not made to be here - and if at some point I was then my trauma made me lack the stability to be a happy, functioning member of society.

Its a problem with me, not everyone else.

I can't blame anyone for telling me these things, I honestly would say basically the same stuff to anyone that told me that.

I don't know what else to add - I'm just done, I've had my fill.
I want to live but at this point life has stopped being a sacred cow to me.
I just want it to be over.

It takes all of my energy to fill the sink with water and soap and I reluctantly throw in some cutlery. Mechanically, I take a sip of water from my plastic bottle, because that is supposed to be healthy. The bin in my kitchen is full and I take out the bag to tie it close. The smell gets worse.

I check on Facebook, turn on a YouTube video in which someone is explaining physics and makes fun of the flat earth. Ten minutes later, silence returns to my house. The water in the sink is cooling down and the smell from the garbage bag has spread to the couch that I‚Äôm sitting on.

Desperately looking for motivation to really start cleaning I wonder: what would you do if this wasn‚Äôt your house, but a friends‚Äô house? Someone whom you care about a lot? Someone who shouldn‚Äôt be living in a dirty shed? Someone who deserves to have a nice place? Someone who should be reminded of the fact that she is worthy of selfcare?

I dry off the first part of the dishes, put the plates in the water and walk downstairs to throw away the garbage. My friend shouldn‚Äôt be living in this smell.

Drink some more water, I tell my friend, while I refresh the soapy water in the sink. Your throat is dry. I take another sip.

The dishes aren‚Äôt that bad, actually. It‚Äôs not so much that there is a big mess, but the kitchen is very small, which makes it seem worse than it is. The last part, plastic tubs and lids, disappear into the water and while the plates are drying to the air a bit, I look around the studio. What else can I do? Vacuum a little? Put the books back into the closet? Dust some stuff? I wish I could do more to help my friend. She‚Äôs going through a rough patch.

But not all of the time. Right?

Today is the first day of my life as a high functioning person with a Major Depression Disorder.  
There it is. It has a name. It‚Äôs a thing. It has been living inside of me since i had a sense of self. It has been wrapping itself around every single thought my mind has ever produced. It has been eating off of me by making me think and overthing about everything that i say and do. Analyzing, regretting, wishing to have said something else, wishing to have done something different. Questioning my own adequacy, blaming myself for all the bad things that would come my way and carrying the weight on my shoulders.¬†  
How do you know it‚Äôs not normal to feel like that all the time if you‚Äôve never really felt differently?¬†  
Because it‚Äôs a thing with a name, it‚Äôs called Major Depression Disorder and it has a way of making you feel and act in a certain way. Don‚Äôt take it personally, MDD isn‚Äôt a picky player. But very much cunning.¬†

I have isolated myself from my family, friends and everything I have known, believing that I was doing them a favor. I am such a bad person, a toxic person. I love them, I don‚Äôt want to hurt them. The only solution is to get far away from them, somewhere my words and actions can‚Äôt affect them.¬†  
MDD loves isolation. It‚Äôs not a team player. It‚Äôs not a team game. It likes to have you all for itself. It loves to make you suffer and feel like if you say out loud how you are feeling, you will be perceived as week. Nobody likes week. Nobody needs week. You deserve isolation.¬†  
That is actually just a part of MDD‚Äôs game.

Where I come from, there‚Äôs no talking about feelings and emotions. I was taught to suck it up. You ignore bad things until they go away. What I learned later is that they don‚Äôt go away. They make a nice playground for MDD.¬†

Reading stories about other people‚Äôs struggles and experiences gave me strenght. I am writing this for myself. I have so many things to figure out. This is the beginning. This is the first step.  
¬†I am also writing this for you. Acknowledging something for what it is, MDD, it‚Äôs not you. It‚Äôs a part of you. It can be tamed. It can be treated. Take it for what it is. It‚Äôs a desease that so many people suffer from. It can be treated, but you are the only one to make that decision. It‚Äôs a decision to get better. If I could change one thing, i would increase the level of mental health awareness and how it's perceived. Well that, and a few more things, but I‚Äôm not telling that.¬†

I can see my mom feels like a failure, so does my dad. This all ends up weighing heavily on my other sibling and I.

It's just feels like a heavy burden. I have no idea how else to describe it. It's just all too much for my mental capacity. Has anyone else in this situation experienced anger like this or this overwhelming feeling of this just being too much. I obviously want to be there for this sibling but I'm already barely holding myself together and I just get this weird anger towards this sibling as well as being over whelmed.

I (22f) am currently experiencing my mental health at an all time low, but in ways I‚Äôve never seen it before. I have strong urges to leave my partner (who I love, and who treats me like gold), I have strong urges to move far away where nobody knows me, or back with my family for comfort. I have what can only be described as ‚Äúepisodes‚Äù that span for several days at a time of extreme irritability, a need to be productive, hyperactivity, and anger, immediately followed by ones of exhaustion, depression, and just general lack of interest in anything. I‚Äôve never experienced anything like this until this past year. This is also being added on top of my diagnosed PTSD from a home invasion a few years ago and general depression I‚Äôve had since my teenage years. I feel like I‚Äôm losing control of myself and like nobody can help me. I‚Äôm going to have a personality assessment next week but I‚Äôm worried that they will just tell me I‚Äôm making things up or that it‚Äôs just my depression, and that they can‚Äôt do anything to help.

Here‚Äôs a little more context: I‚Äôve been having Mental Health issues as early as I can remember but I didn‚Äôt get diagnosed until I was 14 when I was hospitalized after an attempt. I was written off as Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and me being the little informative nut that I am I did more research on it and I always felt like it never fit. I was experiencing things that people with MDD hadn‚Äôt or it was never recorded with it, and I started to look at different disorders.

I didn‚Äôt want to self-diagnose myself (because we all know how annoying that is) but I really wanted an answer because I was doing therapy as well as medication, but they never helped. It either only worked for a period of time, or it did nothing but make me sick. I went to both my psychiatrist and psychologist and begged for a re-evaluation. But kept getting written off because I was 16 when I was asking and doing this research.

It wasn‚Äôt until my dad lost his job and had to switch insurance companies did I get a re-evaluation. I switched from some private insurance to Kaiser, and I wanted to tell them that I already had a diagnosis, but because of some technicalities I had to get re-evaluated. So, whatever, right? I wanted this to happen.

It turns out, that not only was I misdiagnosed, I had multiple different disorders. I am now officially diagnosed as being on the bipolar spectrum, possessing Borderline Personality Traits, as well as Generalized Anxiety Disorder.

So tl;dr
I was diagnosed with depression when I was 14, and I wanted to get another evaluation done because it wasn‚Äôt helping and was denied that request.

Think of any daily task, I'll use taking a shower as an example here! So for people who have the mental and physical energy to do stuff, who maybe arn't depressed, will see this as one simple task! Just showering, and while you're at it, might as well brush your teeth too! Now at least for me, that same ""simple"" task is divided into multiple tasks that have to be done after each other! 

Maybe something like this?: 
1. Find clean clothes
2. Walk to bathroom where the shower is 
3. Take off clothes, jewelry and do additional preparing tasks
      - Put dirdy clothes in the laundry bin/ washer
      - wash your face
4. Comb/ Brush hair
5. Get into the shower 
6. Wash your hair with shampoo
     - Apply shampoo
     - Rinse shampoo
7. Use conditioner
     - Apply conditioner
     - Rinse conditioner 
8. Wash body 
9. Rinse everything 
10. Get out of shower and find a towel
11. Dry yourself with the towel
      - Dry your body
      - Dry your hair (add hair products if needed)
12. Put on clean clothes 
13. Dry the bathroom floor
14. Exit the bathroom, first making sure everything was put back into it's place
- YOU'RE DONE -

That's ~14 tasks for us versus the one single task that mentally well people do! Think about each individual task taking up as much energy as it would take for a mentally well person to do the whole task! For different people it does vary what these individual tasks are, what order they're in and how many there are, but this demonstrates the overall consept! 

Now think about having to brush your teeth too ""while you're at it!"" 1. Gather the mental energy to do the task 2. go to bathroom if not already there 3. find toothbrush 4. find toothpaste 5. Wet toothbrush 6. Put toothpaste on toothbrush 7. Brush approximately 32 teeth! all sides! Every single one! 8. Rinse mouth with water (when done) 9. Wash toothbrush 10. Put toothbrush and toothpaste back to where they belong! 
Yea.. This is also pretty much what it's like to do a task as someone who has ADHD... This is way harder than it should be and you might not be able to change that!

I feel like my childhood trauma that has been a result of emotional, verbal, psychological, and mild physical abuse is not considered as serious to people in my life than other forms, like serious physical abuse or sexual abuse. 

I experienced this form of abuse from my mother and from my family throughout my life, which has led me to become fearful and hesitant around adult women. I use defence mechanisms and disassociate often, especially when these women are in my personal space (my room or my home for instance). I have been open to my dad about this, I have only lived with him for about a year now. He started to date this new girl a week ago and wants to move her in. I expressed my discomfort about this and told him how I would be more comfortable about it. I explained to him why I am the way I am. I explained what happens. 

Yesterday he brings this girl over out of the blue without telling me. I shut myself in my room. It's her first time sleeping over and I didn't sleep. I cried the whole night and eventually packed my stuff and just left and drove an hour to my boyfriends house. 

If I were sexually molested by a man, and was uncomfortable around other adult men I do not know, would he bring strange men into the home suddenly without notice? Having them live and be in the space that I'm supposed to feel safe in without my input? Why would he do this with this girl when I have been open and honest about everything? Trauma is trauma. Every form of trauma deserves to be taken seriously. Every person should be able to have their areas where they feel safe in without worrying about feeling invaded or violated.

On-top of it, he continues to make comments which make me uncomfortable. I don't know how else to tell him to stop. I can't necessarily move out, it's a very complicated process. I would need to quit a job I have only been working for a month and move in with my boyfriend who lives in a very small roach infested apartment or risk going broke and going through my savings living on my own, which I would still need to quit my job because nothing in my city is affordable to live in where I can live alone and bring my cat. I wanted to live there for just a bit more, keep my job for at least 2 months more so I can get support when I get surgery and have to not work for a while, and then transition to moving here when I hopefully start a program I been waitlisted for in the fall.

And then as far as online friends go, so many people my age have friends online from all around the world ""from gaming"" and I actually take pride in the fact that I have quit gaming as it turned into an ""addicting"" habit with me. And another thing is, I know there are other communities as well that could accept me and I try to be active in other communities both online and IRL that share my interests and I rarely make friends there.

And when I make them it's again that feeling ""I am not their only online friend of them, they have others as well, I am not special for them in many way, judging by the amount of followers, the likes and followers they have, the other friends they have are more plenty, and more important to them as I am. They probably just talk to me because they feel sorry for me, or they will just ditch me because I am not as perfect as their other friends are.

Another thing is, Like people meeting up with their foreign friends when they travel to their country and then posting about it online. Well I have tried it once and like out of like 10 people or more one was down for it. I don't know like even that seems to be hard for me and I barely even get accepted. ( I am LGBT BTW) Like I understand that I am probably sentenced to fellow LGBT and ally friends, but there are so few and I am so freaking done of people having many bad friends or having no friends at all and then complaining about it and when I offer themselves to be friends with them, they say no because I am LGBT.

The ones that came before weren't real friends anyway(when I started becoming really depressed around 15 and was no longer fun, they all just dissapeared as if they never existed).

The only reason I haven't killed myself yet is because I am gutless when it comes to any kind of pain, I tried when I was 15 with pills, ended up in the ICU for 3 days with no longlasting damage and again when I was 20 I tried to slit my wrists but that shit was just too painful and I didn't realise just how deep u needed to cut to be successful.

Unlike alot of stories that I've heard from people with suicidal tendencies, I don't see myself as a burden. I think that I would make a really good friend. I don't want anything else other than someone to give a shit about me, I know I'm caring and loyal, I would have my friends back through anything.

Basically I just think I've spent too much time alone, I don't think that I really want to die. I just don't see the point in carrying on like this. I don't know why I can't seem to develop a single meaningful connection with someone who isn't being paid to listen.

I would suggest finding a playlist where the songs are 20+ Minutes long. Most of the playlists feature songs wich are only 3 minutes long or so, wich is really stupid in my opinion.  
I will link one Playlist with long songs below:

ivsbut,MentalHealthSupport,1600521251.0,"First time poster, first time partner of someone with serious psychiatric issues. My fiance had been going downhill for a few months since he lost his job (manic episode) and it really accelerated a few weeks ago - VERY little sleep, very little eating, talking fast about conspiracies and hallucinations, super happy, spending random money. I knew he needed help, and I've been asking him for years to seek psychiatric care but he always refused. I respected that decision since he had never done anything awful until three days ago when it all came to a head - I had to run out of the house with the dog (who was terrified) and call the cops because he was dissociated (didn't remember his own name or where he was) and was completely out of control (screaming, crying, and rolling on the floor). He did ask to go to the hospital during the episode, which is great, but he also pushed me over backwards when I hesitated. Thankfully I am uninjured (I was checked by doctors). He has never laid a hand on me before. He has been in the hospital ever since, and was even transferred to a special facility hours away, under sedation. He has been so combative and resistant to treatment that he was involuntarily committed. He has been hospitalized before, but usually for depression and not within the last 10 years, and never like this. His parents and I are shocked.

My friends and my psychiatrist are split - some stay just take care of myself and don't make any important decisions yet, others say there's absolutely no way I could ever marry this guy, let alone have kids with him in the future. I get the sense I would lose a lot of support if I forgave him (and of course my plan is ONLY to do so if he is constantly under psychiatric care and complying with meds), which makes me sad.

My fiance had been calling me angrily from the facility, blaming everything on me, telling me we are broken up and I must immediately leave the house, etc. I have ignored it all and told his team to not let him call anymore, which was heartbreaking, but had to be done. He can still speak to his parents, so he's not fully alone, and his care team calls me frequently to check in and I offer what assistance I can. Interestingly, even though he is saying awful things to me, he signed a full waiver for me to help with his care. He also had some important papers sent to the house for me right before everything went down. So I think he knew something was wrong, and I think the true man is in there somewhere, looking for help.

I am trying not to take what he has said about how abusive I am, how he's going to get COVID because of me, etc to heart because I know it's the illness talking, and I know they have seen this angry behavior before in manic, psychotic patients. My psychiatrist said she has seen this all before and she would be happy to help him if he stabilizes and is looking for long-term help. In the meantime I have to put up boundaries so that he doesn't manipulate me since he is clearly ill and not himself. 

Does anyone have suggestions for how to get through this if he eventually leaves the hospital after refusing long-term treatment and still thinks I'm the devil incarnate? He has no job due to COVID, and therefore would have no insurance if I'm gone, and would likely lose the house and the dog, both of which he loves dearly. Not to mention me. Or worse, what if he has a terrible experience in the hospital, or gets complications from COVID? He's hours away and I don't know how good the facility is. I know neither of these outcomes would be my fault, but I love this man with all my heart, and I so wish I could help him right now.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthSupport/comments/ivsbut/my_fiance_is_in_the_hospital_for_a_psychotic/,"My fiance is in the hospital for a psychotic break, two weeks before our wedding",,16,20,0.88

I go outside to walk, play with my pets, bake, follow motivational instagram accounts, but nothing helps. I also have gotten off my birth control recently to see if that would help.

Now I have had depression for several years. I never really got better it never really changed at all. It was just there making my life harder.
But last year I have met my significant other. An absolutely amazing and sweet person. They make me feel good about myself most of the time.
But still my depression doesn't go away.
Of course I know it cannot just go away. It takes time and often therapy. I have had therapy for more than two years but it did nothing. It helped in the beginning but then it just became a chore to go there. And now that I have a loving SO I still feel like a piece of crap when they aren't around. And the fact that I feel this way makes me feel even worse. I also became far more anxious about quite literally everything.

hjn6td,MentalHealthSupport,1593651271.0,"My brother went to hang out with his buddies and have a fun time, and was called in the middle of the night by his (female) friend who had just swallowed a bunch of pills and alcohol in an attempt. From what he just told me, she was freaking out that she's about to die, was somewhat delusional and he had to first talk her out of killing herself and then stay on the phone with her to calm her down and just be with her so she doesn't completely lose her mind (like I said, she was freaking tf out). She was eventually escorted by some friend it seems...

The point is, he shouldn't have to be the one to carry this on his shoulders. He called me now, at 2am, just to tell me what was going on, he's really shaken and he needed to tell someone. Luckily he's with a friend and not alone, so at least that. He said he's never been so stressed in his life (no surprise there). Basically what I'm getting at is I want to make sure this doesn't turn onto a trauma for him if I can help it, I want to help and support him as much as I possibly can and make sure he deals with it in a healthy way (and doesn't put the responsibility on himself). As an older sister, I'll literally do anything to lift the weight off of him and protect him from as much pain as I can. I know how big of a toll this stuff can have on one's mental health. What is something I could do...?

There's another layer to this, this friend apparantely has some past trauma this is related to, and her parents seem to be quite awful/dismissive, or absolutely not helpful in the very least, her mum is a psychologist but doesn't want her to get professional help for some reason...?? Like she allegedly tells her she doesn't need a therapist & stuff, idk. Point is, this girl is obviously in danger for her life and needs medical/professional help, and needs it right now. And my brother feels he has to call her mother tomorrow and tell her what happened, and make sure she realizes just how serious it is and that the girl needs to go to a hospital or sth; he's obviously terrified that he's gonna make it worse for her as she obviously didn't want her parents to find out, he's worried they're gonna be dismissive, and just generally doesn't really know how to go about it, you can imagine.. there's no manual for this shit. I'm no wiser. This is such an awful situation, I don't know myself what the right course of action would be here. As for my brother though, this feels like an awful lot of pressure and responsibility that he should in no way have. There's no way I'm letting him deal with that alone. But yeah... honestly I'm just as clueless. If anyone has any experience with a similar thing from either side, what might be a good thing for me/us to do?

Any insight would be hugely appreciated. Thank you to everyone who read this awfully long and unorganized ramble. If you can't tell I'm kind of freaked out for him. I just wish I could take it on for him, you know...

So last year I booked two weeks off at the end of March starting tomorrow, plans to visit my grandparents and mother (both abroad, different countries) and my dad was supposed to be visiting me and we were supposed to be running a half marathon together. 

Because of the pandemic everything has been cancelled and I am unable to see any of my family, my plans have all been ruined. 

My friends are all self-isolating, all the pubs/bars/cafes/EVERYTHING around me is in lockdown, my gym has closed, the library has closed, basically everything I do for fun has closed. 

I live in a country with typically poor weather so it‚Äôs not like I can even go out for the day for a walk in one of the country parks or something. 

To make matters worse I live with my MiL who is also self isolating for the next two weeks and while I get on with her, I‚Äôm not much of a people person and prefer my own company. She makes my anxiety worse by constantly hovering around and I‚Äôm always on edge thinking I‚Äôm getting in her way. 

So basically my two weeks holiday that I have been looking forward too for a year are gonna be spent with me lying in bed aimlessly scrolling social media on my phone and trying to stay out the way and I don‚Äôt think I can take it. 

I like having my little routine of going to the gym in the morning then the coffee shop followed by the library to study in the afternoon and I‚Äôm gonna be so lost without that routine and my anxiety is through the roof and I am already panicking that‚Äôs it never going to go back to normal and my shaky plans that I‚Äôve been making and my little goals I‚Äôve been working for are just pointless and I might as well forget them and I just cant reassure myself that things are gonna be okay even though I‚Äôm over reacting and being really insensitive while there‚Äôs people suffering and people who have lost loved ones and I‚Äôm just complaining about my routine being lost

I‚Äôm sorry if this is the wrong place for this but if anyone can offer advice on how to take my anxiety down a level when I can‚Äôt even go and get my prescription renewed and I know I‚Äôm gonna run out of meds soon so that isn‚Äôt helping either.

Whether you're just starting to accept that you need help, have achieved the change you've been working toward, or anywhere in between, let's talk about it.

For example, I'm 38 and have battled depression, anxiety, OCD, PTSD, and DID since my childhood. It's taken a very long time and a lot of work, but I'm now waking up in the morning glad to be alive. It's somewhere I never thought I'd be, I thought the best I could hope for was waking up and not wanting to be dead. I used to get angry at people who told me to keep fighting because I was in so much pain all the time that I thought they were incredibly selfish to try and keep me alive.

I can actually remember the turning point; it was earlier this year, about two weeks after a suicide attempt. I looked at my son and suddenly had a moment of clarity; I'd wanted something to live for and I had it and I still wanted to die... why? And I realised it was because it was the only way I knew, and I decided I wanted to learn another way.

Two weeks later I found out I was pregnant again, and that clarity turned into dedicated efforts to get well. It's been 8 months of retraining my automatic thinking on a conscious level, and I still need meds, but the automatic thoughts are definitely changing and that right there has made the difference.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthSupport/comments/dqzya5/lets_try_something_positive/,Let's try something positive :),,17,0,1.0

(I‚Äôm still crazy but everyone around me loves me, and I‚Äôm lucky like that)
I work in finance/ banking, and met a woman recently who literally broke down at my desk when I asked about her grown children. 
Her son was a graduate and living at home still because of a mental break a couple years prior, after college. He was diagnosed with quite a few things (I won‚Äôt name here, for anonymity). But she just broke. She told me everything, and how hard it was for her, and how she didn‚Äôt know how to give him the encouragement he needed to know he could live life anyways. 
At first, I was being professional (I gave her a hug) and I just listened, but she kept going on and on about how she loved her son and saw so much potential in him, but the PEOPLE AT THE HOSPITAL TOLD HIM HE WOULD NEVER WORK OR LIVE A NORMAL LIFE! This infuriated me, and 10 seconds later he walks in. Seemingly normal young man, asked me for some coffee, and told his mom he was gonna head back to the car. I‚Äôm even madder now at the doctors. 
So I end up closing my office door, and I told her quietly I had a mental illness, and I have a successful career, a family, because I decided not to let it define me. It‚Äôs like cancer, you didn‚Äôt choose it, and as long as you take your medicine and see your doctor, it can‚Äôt take your life. She bawled more, 
Her son apparently had been recently put on the right medication, and was eager to start working again. I asked what he majored in- turns out it was the same major as my brother. 
We talked more, and I told her she rocked as a mama because she tried to understand her sons Illness and help him instead of shaming him. 

Long story short: I contacted my brother and asked if he needed any help where he was. They need help. Connected the two, and he will hopefully start working in his field soon. God is pretty good at connecting people.

Also, I can‚Äôt believe a doctor could be so dense. 
We are people too. Mental illness sucks. I have good and bad days and all that in between. 
But we are more than just the organ that isn‚Äôt working. And we are super capable to achieving great things. 

If your great thing is you woke up this morning, and showered, that‚Äôs fucking awesome. 
If your great thing is you got a job, fuck yeah!!
If your great thing is you met someone you connected with, that‚Äôs fucking phenomenal!

qdbcxf,MentalHealthSupport,1634886181.0," I have seasonal depression, panic disorder, and GAD and these are some of the things I do to help my seasonal depression and anxiety, they may not work for you, but I hope it helps someone out there. It can be hard to do them all, but I always try to do at least 2. Whatever works for you.

(Also you might see this around a couple subs, but I want to spread this as much as possible in the hopes it helps someone.)

1. Keep your curtains open, even if it's gloomy outside, natural light is still better than artificial light or no light at all. The lack of vitamin D in fall and winter months is the main cause of seasonal depression so getting as much as you can is important. You can consider getting vitamin D supplements or even a light therapy lamp if you have the money.
2. Keep in contact with people, talk to your family, friends, bf/gf, whoever. We often want to isolate ourselves but that is one of the worst things we can do. You don't have to talk to them about all your problems if you're not comfortable, but just having someone's company can help, even if it's online.
3. Create. I like to keep myself busy by being creative. I'm in graphic design so I like making posters, websites, packaging, etc., Other things can be painting, drawing, knitting, making music, literally anything. The act of creating something gives purpose, to me at least. And can remain pretty cheap depending.
4. Try to eat as well as possible. You don't have to go on a whole diet and cut out all junk food, or sugar, or whatever. But, I tend to get into the habit of eating a lot of junk food, which in turn makes me want to lay in bed and sleep even more, which obviously doesn't help. Maybe don't buy as much fast food, limit it to once or twice a week. Cook a homemade meal at least once a week. Even if you're not good at cooking, learning isn't hard especially with the vast amount of recipes on the internet, plus it gives you something to do and you get to create something! At the very least, try to get the nutrients you need, vitamin D!, protein, calcium, all of that, is important and can make a difference.
5. If you don't like being creative, learn something! Download Duolingo and learn a language, research any topics you're interested in, maybe keep a notebook of all the stuff you learn, learn a new skill, learn an instrument, take a free online class (or paid if you have the money) again, anything.
6. Try to keep at least semi-active, you don't have to be doing full workouts 3 times a week. Even cleaning can be exercise. Even if it's cold out, bundle up and go for a walk, sometimes the cold air can be a bit of a refresher and snow can be pretty (if it snows where you live LOL). Yoga and just general stretching can help if you're laying in bed or sitting at a computer all day.
7. That brings me to my next one. Keep your area clean. Whether it's your bedroom or apartment, house, whatever. You don't have to do some deep spring cleaning or anything, but just training yourself to clean up dishes right after you use them, putting your laundry away right away, putting things right into the garbage, keep your floors vacuumed, don't hoard dishes or drinks in your room, putting things back where they belong, etc. Even if you can do only one of these things, that's enough.
8. Next point, I can't remember where I read it but someone said ""try to do one productive thing every day"". It can literally be the smallest thing, like taking some dishes downstairs and putting them in the dishwasher/washing them, or taking a shower. I noticed sometimes when I do one productive thing, it's easier for me to get into doing more. It can be hard to just get up sometimes but literally the smallest things can make a difference.
9. Keep up with personal hygiene. You don't have to be getting all dressed up, putting makeup on, whatever all the time. But, even a simple skin care routine can help, I love cleanser, scrub, and moisturizer. Taking care of your hair, eating decent, exercising a bit here and there when you can. Even showering cause even that can be hard sometimes. I personally love painting my own nails and literally have not had bare nails once in 7 years and it makes me feel a lot better (plus it keeps me from biting my nails! LOL)
10. As clich√© as it sounds, drink water. You may not even notice a difference but it is very important and we can often forget about it when we're in a slump.
11. Be sure to regularly take any medications your are currently prescribed (if any) and talk to your doctor if they're not working, you don't feel right, or any other reason.
12. Work and/or school. Whether you're in high school, college, working part-time, working full time, not working, whatever it may be. But, try your best in them, again it can be hard because of the depression which I get. But, ask for help when you need it, keep yourself organized, don't let assignments and tasks build up, study for tests as best you can, keep a schedule, communicate with your teachers, coworkers, managers, whoever it may be.
13. Good sleep schedule. This one I don't personally follow, because my sleep schedule is absolutely fucked right now, but it's on my list. But, not only do you get proper energy, but it's been proven to help you mentally as well, and is one more step to a good schedule.
14. If you're really not doing so well, consider therapy and/or maybe medication. I understand money and availability can be an issue, but there are also resources online, or maybe through your school/work.

Overall, getting as much light as possible, personal hygiene, communicating with other people, and keeping busy are the most important things to me. Whatever works for you, just take it one day at a time and do what you can. Every little bit helps. I hope this helps even a little bit! I wish the best for the everyone!

I‚Äôve been fighting depression for a while now, having some days more manageable than others, but recently I‚Äôve had a stretch of bad days. Instead of distancing myself and not communicating with my boyfriend (which can make matters worse) I decided I was just going to bite the bullet and tell him. 

And let me tell you!!!! I feel amazing. It wasn‚Äôt easy, like I literally broke down and ugly cried, but I told him how I was feeling in as many words as I could (depression is impossible to explain) but he was very accepting and helpful.

Like I said, my problems didn‚Äôt disappear, but I feel like I don‚Äôt have to fight this battle alone; like a million ton of bricks have been lifted off my shoulders. 

Moral of the story: You are not alone. You will never have to be alone. You just have to tell someone. We will all get through the dark together, we just have to reach out to the light.

After not dying I spent a year in what felt like mental purgatory, feeling completely numb to everything, both happy and sad. After a while I found that laughing at everything helped me, even if the worst happened I would just laugh to myself, and I thought this made me strong like I had moved beyond nihilism. A certain part of me still believes this, however I think I've developed a fear of ever being as sad as I was a couple years ago, and my brain has found a way to ignore sadness completely.

More recently, in the space of 2-3 months, with no warning on both occasions, I was completely overcome with sadness and fear that I would go back to being sad, crying profusely for about an hour, and then it just stopped and I was back to normal.

I'm not entirely sure whats happening, I'm afraid that because of my quick fixes in the past I'm doomed to crash and burn horribly in the future, but I dont believe that any of this qualifies me to see a therapist, especially these days when so many people who need it more than me can't get it.

I'm posting from mobile so please ignore formatting issues. 

My brother and I went through some messed up things growing up... Our mother was a super manipulative and abusive alcoholic who convinced us that our dad abused us sexually.

When I was 12 we got taken away from her and basically moved from one family to the next. When my brother was 18 and writing his finals he began to obsessively play games and he said that he wanted to commit suicide. He got sent to a psychologist who then sent him to a psychiatrist who prescribed medication but that didn't seem to work... So he got booked into a hospital. While he was there we found a stash of all of his medication at home which he hadn't been taking. 

He threatened to commit suicide again and my guardian basically phoned the psychologist who said he was just manipulating us and we should call his bluff. We did. He didn't kill himself... 

Fast forward a few years and I have been diagnosed with depression and after what my brother did I can't bring myself to talk about it. I just know there are days where I don't want to get up and face the day... Days when I hurt so much and don't know why... Days when I wish I didn't exist.

I want to apologize in advance if any of my language or terminology is outdated or offensive. I promise it is not my intent. Please let me know if there is preferred terminology I should use instead. 

My neighbor is an older gentleman who, I believe, suffers from schizophrenia or some other mental health problem. Some nights, he will loudly and angrily talk to himself with sentences that are barely coherent, and to people who are not there. He is so far harmless, but recently the rants have included racial slurs and he has been picking up bricks and stones while ranting. It makes my friends uncomfortable, and at times it can feel unsafe.

My question is- is there someone I can call during these episodes? I don‚Äôt want to call the police, who are woefully unprepared to deal with mental health issues, but I‚Äôm worried it might escalate and he might inadvertently hurt me, my friends, or my property, or himself.

g2eaqy,MentalHealthSupport,1587041431.0,"Hi everyone! This is a *really* long one but I need to vent... My parents have been helping me through this but they have their own stresses at the moment and I don't want to burden them anymore about this, and I don't want to talk to any more friends about this because I'm scared of losing them. I'm doing OK now, but I guess I'm not fully over what happened.

I've been feeling down the past couple of months. It's not the first time I've felt like this, we suspect it is some form of depression, but I can't seek professional help, partially because of COVID-19, and partially because I'm scared that if I am diagnosed with something like that, they'll take my right to fly away (student pilot), and flying is one of the few things keeping me going. I know I'm not a flight risk, I'd never do anything to hurt others, I don't need some doctor diagnosing me with something that prohibits me from doing the thing I love.

***If you are sensitive to the topic of self-harm or suicide, please don't read any further. I'd hate for my story to hurt others.***

Anyway, this all came to a head in what was probably the lowest day of my life, a few weeks ago... My mum had OD'd twice in the months prior, and both times I was the one to drive her to hospital (I'm happy to report that she's doing a lot better now, it's not who she is as a person), all of the ten or so birthday plans I tried to make (my birthday was very recently) were cancelled because the COVID-19 rules kept getting stricter and stricter, work was stressing me out (I work fast food), and my uni can't seem to get their shit together.

On that day, I was in the middle of one of my all-too-common ""anxiety attacks"", and I just couldn't take it anymore, so I took my keys and went on a drive. During the drive, I started crying uncontrollably, a rarity for me. I didn't stop until about half an hour after I'd arrived at my destination - a lookout on a cliff, high enough that a jump would mean certain death. After lingering there for a bit, I knew deep down that I wasn't gonna die that day. Truth is, I was too scared to end my own life. I didn't really want to die, I just didn't want to live either, if it was gonna be in a constant state of pain and misery and stress. In that time, I guess my parents had figured out what was happening... they started calling me, texting me. I picked up the phone long enough to tell them (through my tears) where I was and that I was alive, but I didn't want to talk to them (because I didn't think it would help, and because I didn't want to burden them), so I hung up. So there I was, sitting there at the top of this cliff, with one half of me telling me to jump, and the other part saying to talk to someone first, as everyone always says to. I guess the latter won out.

This is where my two friends enter the story, Jack (16M) and Charlie (17M) (not their real names obviously). I'd only known the two of them for about half a year each, but we have identical interests, and we became close friends very quickly. They are mutual friends, but they only know each other because of me. While I do admit there is a slight age gap between me (19M) and them, they have assured me multiple times since we met that it's not a concern for them or their parents, and they are both mature for their age. Hell, Charlie and I were even planning an international trip together (until COVID hit lol), but he comes into this later. 

Anyway, I've helped them both through so many of their own problems, and they knew about my own problems and seemed to be OK with it, so in that moment, I reached out to Jack for help. I called him, and we talked. I told him where I was, and explained that I was too scared to jump. I didn't want to die, but didn't want to live. I won't get into the details of that call, but we talked about it for a few minutes, and made me promise that I would come home, and said that we'd play a multiplayer game together, and have a chat about things. I'll admit, he did make me feel better long enough for my dad to find me. We drove home, I talked to my parents a little bit and retreated back to my room. 

Jack had sent me a text a while ago to confirm I still wanted to play, and I replied that I was ready when he was. I waited for a response to that for hours, I didn't hear from him until later that night. When he finally did respond, it was to say that what I did fucked him up. He said that I should have dealt with the situation better, he was only 16, I had made a 16-year-old cry. He also said that he couldn't be friends with me anymore, that he would never be able to look at me at the same way again. It was effectively a goodbye message. After the day I'd had, I was absolutely devastated. To know that I had caused so much pain to someone I cared about, to know that he felt that way... It crushed me. It also meant that everything he said when I was at that lookout was a lie. He assured me that I wasn't burdening him, as long as I was OK, that I would come home and everything would be fine. I guess not. With all of the COVID stuff happening, all I wanted was for life to return to normal, so for him to pull a 180 like that after promising that he'd be there for me... It really hurt. I'd offered my help with his problems in the past, and he abandoned me when I needed his. 

In hindsight, I realise that someone younger than me probably wasn't the smartest choice for mental health support, but to turn your back on a friend, to say those things to him when he already feels like shit, is absolutely disgusting to me. I felt betrayed. If the situation was reversed, I would have been there for him, regardless of my own feelings. But despite this, with the help of my parents, I came to terms with this unfortunate turn of events, understood why he did what he did, and I don't hold a grudge against him. What he did was wrong, but I realise that I put him under a lot of stress for a 16 year old, and I guess that was the only way he could deal with it.

This is where Charlie enters the scene. While this stuff with Jack was unfolding, I was playing a multiplayer game with Charlie, to take my mind off it. After seeing what Jack had said to me though, I wasn't in the mood to continue playing online games with Charlie, so I explained that I needed to go, giving him a quick rundown on what had happened, making sure to mention that I was just having a really bad day, that I felt better after talking with my parents and that I will be OK. He seemed OK with that, and I hung up and did my best to go to sleep.

The next day, I woke up feeling better... Last night's events were still fresh in my mind, but I was doing my best to get past them. I went out, and used my birthday money to buy myself a new (secondhand) camera. I figured that focusing on my photography hobby would be a good way to keep myself busy during the COVID-19 thing, since it's something I can do alone, in non-busy areas, and can pass off as exercise. You know what? I was actually having a good day considering everything, and was telling Charlie as much. I said that I was feeling good today, that I'd bought a new camera and was taking pictures with it. He was replying, everything was fine, so imagine my surprise when out of the blue, he then also says to me (in no uncertain terms) that he couldn't deal with my shit and that he had to ""cut ties"" with me for the sake of his mental health. That international trip we planned? He didn't feel comfortable with it anymore. After I got over my initial shock, I was furious and upset. I understood and accepted why Jack needed some time away from me (as he later clarified), but Charlie? He wasn't even involved, really. After I calmed down a bit (took a while, I'll admit) I pretty much said to him that while that's his decision and that I would leave him alone, I said that it was a dick move on his part. I can't put into words how devastated I was, now that I had now lost two of my closest friends at a time when I needed them the most. He tried to defend what he said, he said that his request for space wasn't unreasonable. He's right. If he had said he just needed some 'space', some time to process what happened, I would have understood. However, he didn't ask for space, he said that he needed to cut ties with me indefinitely, two very different things. I later found out that he and Jack had talked about what had happened to me earlier that day. I have no doubt that it was something Jack said that sparked Charlie's decision. That's the part that hurt the most.

Cut to tonight, a few weeks on. I feel so much better than I do two weeks ago, but the weather has kept me inside and I've kinda been alone with my thoughts, so I need to vent to someone about what happened. Jack and I reconciled and we're actually speaking again... we're almost back to how we were before, actually. I will always commend him for having the maturity to bounce back from something like that. As I said, I don't hold anything against him for what he did. My mental health issues had put him under a lot of stress, and I understand why he acted in that way. Charlie, on the other hand... we haven't spoken since that night. Honestly, even if he did text me again, I'm not sure I'd forgive him. He wasn't really involved, so to jump on the bandwagon (so to speak) and say such hurtful things so soon after, shouldn't be forgivable. However, if he ever does text me, I'd be happy to give him the benefit of the doubt and hear him out. Maybe what I was going through triggered something in him, maybe he regrets saying what he said. People say stupid shit when they're stressed, I've come to realise. But, I'll leave that up to him.

Anyway, if you've made it this far, thanks for listening to my story I guess... I guess the important thing is that everyone is OK (not necessarily great, but OK) for the most part. I'm OK, Jack's OK, and Charlie is apparently OK (Jack and Charlie still talk to each other... that part doesn't sit well with me but it's not my business so I deal with it). I still have 'good' and 'bad' days, but I haven't had one of my 'attacks' since then so that's good I suppose. At the end of the day, I've learned a lot from this, and hopefully this experience will make me a better person. I have sworn to myself that I will never go back to that dark place again, I just hope that's a promise I can keep. Anyway, I appreciate any advice, feedback, comments, whether that be positive or negative. If there's anyone out there that can relate with this, just know that it does heal with time, even if you might not believe me. Just keep yourself busy, and it will get better. Thanks :)

Update 1:(14 January 2023) Today is my last night in my parents house. This was supposed to be the last night of my life. I intended to kill myself tomorrow but given that I've decided to give it one last try , I won't . Not yet . I'm flying back to my hostel tomorrow . 

My warden is abusive and my flatmates bully me for my hormonal problems . I'm really determined to turn my life around this time or die trying. In an attempt to surround myself with good people and live in a healthy environment, I've decided to move into a 1BR apartment with a friend. 

I intend to finish college and take professional courses to boost my resume . I had emotionally moved on from this family long ago . It's time I manifest it. I'm just waiting to get a job . 

I've fixed up my resume and I apply to multiple fresher jobs daily. I've made it a habit now. I passed the screening test in one company and they are yet to schedule a job interview for me. If that goes well , I'm positive, I'll get the job . The day I get a job , I'll cut off my family




Update 2 : (27February 2023) I can't begin to explain how much my life has turned around in the last 1 month. So I didn't get the initial job I was shortlisted for and I was so distraught and disheartened, I stopped giving a fuck. For a good 2 weeks ai barely got out of bed, starved myself and then came the final ultimatun from my family. 

I turn 21 in March which is the legal age of marriage in my country and they wanted me to go back to their house and marry a stranger. Typical arrange marriage bullshit. This was 3 weeks ago. I say fuck this and start revaluating my resume. Fixed up some things and reached out to my college placement cell. I applied for jobs in. 3 companies. Got shortlisted for all 3 and got the job in the 2 nd company I had applied to. Not only did I get the job, I also got a part time position because they were really impressed by my final interview and in the end I walked out with the highest package among all the other 4 people who were selected. 

The company is great. Work culture is awesome. The pay is as generous as it can be for an average fresher like me. Also it's an interesting job in the department I wanted. 

Giving up is definitely not an option anymore. I just got my official offer letter an hour ago. Signed the lease to my new apartment far away from the abusive family and most importantly I am starting to save up for therapy. 

There will be one last update on this post. I'm so excited to share my progress with y'all. Thank you so much for all the support. I couldn't have done it without youüß°",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthSupport/comments/106ptzj/the_ending/,The Ending,,14,26,1.0

xpn6wx,MentalHealthSupport,1664300107.0,"Hi folks. I've been struggling with anxiety and depression as far as I can remember. I've been managing my anxiety pretty well, been taking my meds and going to therapy every week. There's also a social worker at the institution I'm taking my technical education. I also talk to him every week.

I can't say the same about my depression, though. I'll be back at my psychiatrist in a week or two, for the past two months (or since the last time I had my appointment with my psychiatrist), things have been spiraling out of control. I have been going for days without brushing my teeth, taking showers every other day. Because, to be honest, most days I wish I hadn't woken up, so it's been really hard to take care of myself. My skincare routine generally consists of two or three products, but even that I haven't been keeping up. 

I need help, and to me, the most alarming thing has been the lack of care with my oral hygiene. Surprisingly or not, by breath doesn't smell like anything at all, and my teeth aren't yellow. Maybe that's because I haven't been eating properly as well.

phuulf,MentalHealthSupport,1630773391.0,"I genuinely don‚Äôt understand how people do it, I really don‚Äôt. How can anyone not see how pointless all this is? I mean, maybe I can understand how people who actually manage to believe in a religion or some higher power or something can think their life matters in some ‚Äúgrand scheme‚Äù, but if you‚Äôre like me and don‚Äôt have a spiritual bone in your body, how could you not see that you don‚Äôt matter?

Got asked in therapy the other day why I‚Äôm constantly suicidal and I said it‚Äôs because, well, what am I actually *doing* here? I mean if you really boil it down, life is just a series of jumping from meaningless distraction to meaningless distraction over and over again, constantly chasing some kinda fucking happiness dragon, just to pass the time, to tick down the fucking clock until, maybe, one day, if you‚Äôre lucky, you die in your sleep. And then you‚Äôre just dead and that‚Äôs it. Nothing you ever did matters to you anymore. Depending on how you lived your life, *maybe* the stuff you did matters to a couple more people for a little longer until they either forgot or die and then it‚Äôs just all gone, like it never existed at all for the mass majority of people. And if you do leave behind some kinda long-lasting legacy like Einstein or Martin Luther King or someone, what the fuck do you care now? You don‚Äôt even know it. You‚Äôre dead.

And I get that some people enjoy the journey or whatever but I don‚Äôt. I simply don‚Äôt fucking care about anything. Out of everything I‚Äôve experienced in life so far, I can honestly say I wouldn‚Äôt give a shit if I never experienced any of it again, which isn‚Äôt even to say it‚Äôs all been horrible, I‚Äôve just never had an actually impactful positive experience. It‚Äôs all just been fleeting at best. And I‚Äôve had plenty of impactful negative experiences and I dunno, it just kinda seems like the equation just doesn‚Äôt balance. Life sucks more than it‚Äôs good and I really don‚Äôt see any incentive at all to wanna prolong it any longer. 

And then you factor in that we love in a society that purposefully spaces out the good things, especially if you‚Äôre fucking broke all the time cause your mental issues prevent you from holding down jobs for more than about 3 months like me. So much of the shit you‚Äôre trying to work towards is just locked behind a fucking paywall that feels basically insurmountable to me at this point. Case and point, thought it might be an ok distraction to try and replace my furniture with shit I built myself, but then I looked at how much even the most basic tools I‚Äôd need to do it cost, plus the cost of materials and realised that it‚Äôs basically gonna take me a fucking year just to put aside the money required to do even some basic fucking distraction like that. It just feels like when shitty game developers pad out the length of a game by cramming hours and hours of tedious grinding in between every main quest. It just feels fucking cheap and it doesn‚Äôt need to be like this, yet there‚Äôs nothing you can fucking do about it either.

I dunno, every time I think about life, I feel like I come to the same conclusion.

mtk1vf,MentalHealthSupport,1618775507.0,"So for the past couple of days my SH/SI (self harm/suicidal ideation) urges have been getting worse. My antidepressants haven't been working (I'm on like my third different antidepressant), I feel like I have absolutely no one to talk to, and my fucking family keeps aggravating me. They never listen to a goddamn word I say, they keep asking me if I want to get my hair cut (which I DON'T because I'm trying to experiment with my gender identity), and my sister called me fat a couple of days ago (I mean she didn't use those exact words but she pointed out that I have a gut, which I'm already pretty sensitive about because I gained 30 pounds in 2 months).

I tried talking to one of my closest friends, hoping that it would provide at least SOME form of relief, but I felt absolutely nothing; if anything, I felt like the weight on my shoulders got heavier. I've been formulating a plan in my mind of how I intend to hurt myself (I won't go into immense details but basically there's a knife in a kitchen drawer that wasn't locked away with the rest of the sharp objects). The only thing that is stopping me is that I don't want to go back to another hospital (I've already been in three). That's it. Not my friends, not my family. I feel like most of them don't even care, and those that do care, I'm just a burden to them.

I really wish I had a shoulder to cry on. I really don't want to hurt/kill myself but I feel like that's what is most likely going to happen. I just want to feel better, and in the past, acting on those urges made me feel at least a little bit of relief in the moment.

Also on a bit of a sidenote, my parents keep referring to me in masculine terms (a guy, my sister's brother, their son, etc) and it's making me feel pretty uncomfortable. Like I mentioned earlier I'm trying to figure out my gender identity, and I don't think that it matches up with the one I was assigned at birth. And I'm really terrified of telling them about this because it took them 2 YEARS to accept that I'm bisexual (and I still don't think they're fully supportive of that), so I don't think they'll ever accept that I'm anything but a cisgender male. Which I really don't think I am.

Edit: I have figured it out. I am trans. And proud!

Anyways, I feel like I'm at the end of my rope at this point. Someone please help me, I don't know what else to do anymore. I feel like I've tried everything, and nothing seems to make me feel any better. Please help me. Somebody. Anybody.

She sked what was the problem. I told her the semester just ended and i wanna take a break because i am stressed out. Then i jokingly said ""existing sucks"". She started spitting shit again. That my mind is sick. Because she knew what happened why i am like this. She's aware that it was their fault why i isolate myself from everyone. She keeps screaming that it was in the past. That it is my fault why i am being always in pain. 

I hope it is that easy. I was 10 years old when something happened in our family. It continues until I was 15 honestly until now that i am 20. The verbal abuse, the violence, and the screaming. Ever since I was a kid i learned to shut up because for them it is not my business. So i was left watching the violence. The rage was building up more and more. I never said a single word. 

She shouted earlier, ""I am carrying everything just to provide for you."" I never intend to hurt her that way. I understand what she's been through but it does not excuse that she was the reason why I turned out the way I am today. Her and dad. Never once in my life they approached me with understanding. I don't want to say anything cause i know they are in pain too. So i am left with ocean of negative emotions. I tried approaching them about going to therapy and they just shouted at me. 

She mentioned my self harm and my smoking. I never learned how to approach my problems in a healthy way. Always left out with everything. I feel like a huge disappointment that i should be grateful. I am. But the traumas keep on flashing back whenever something triggers me and i have a sharp memory. My 10 yeas old self watching them. The painful screams, the violence, and the cries just keep ringing in my mind. There are times i grabbed my hair so hard my attempt to brush off all the scenes in my head.

I have it mostly with people that are invasive and abusive to me in the first line, so i think basically i lack the confidence of realizing that there's nothing sad or negative about it to detach myself from these people. I then feel as i would need to excuse, take it back or do something to make these people happy again. Its like fractures of short-movies that are emotionally overloaded and it goes so far, that i'm physically unstable and partially unable to do something. A similar and often overwhelming guilt i feel sometimes even about things.For example, if i don't like a color, or a song, or a taste, i have nearly religiously appearing attachments to feel sorry, because i'm afraid to hurt the feelings of that taste or whatever it's about.Depending on the situation, this can lead to almost ritualistic monologues that express either extreme violence and sadism, or extreme glorification of the persons or things i got stuck on.In both cases this often results in another cascade of feeling guilty, either because i regret the harm i projected on the other part of the subject, or because i feel extremely guilty for betraying my former position towards the person / their behavior in glorifiying them to make it excusable what they said or did to me.  
The same is for when i reflect about myself.

I've done a lot of risky things in the past including risky sex with of legal age strangers when I was 15 (I'm 18 now) and drug use. I've talked about it in more detail on my other posts that can be found on my profile if you are interested in reading. My emotions were out of control and made me do a lot of irresponsible activities that I hated and felt like I had no control over. Someone with BPD said that they could relate and said that their brain felt like it was possessing them to do bad things to themselves such as the things I've done and also said that risky/unhealthy sex is also a form of self harm and strong signs of trauma and BPD. 

I feel completely helpless and frustrated at myself when people say that I was in control of my actions and responses back then when I felt like I was not and felt like I was a spectator with no control in my own life. It's really irrational but when I'm hurt or in pain I do a lot of irrational things and I can't control. It hurts me a lot because I don't know how to respond and they think negatively of me. Someone said that my actions were involuntary in the sense that mental health problems allowed me to go to a place that in a healthy mind I would have never chosen. My FP makes me feel the best I've ever felt in my life because of his love, affection and attention but unfortunately it's the other way around for him but he still loves and cares about me but is just deeply hurt and I want him to understand. 

He thinks I enjoyed the things I've done because I did it so much in the past and he is greatly affected by it negatively and so am I because he's my FP and my life revolves around him.

jkzotj,MentalHealthSupport,1604074315.0,"Sorry for the super long post, Please take the time to read it thoroughly, I really need someone's help...

About a week and a half ago on my Instagram story i posted something that my friend didn't like very much, this wasn't the first time either. This has probably been the fifth time or so, It was regarding feminism and my friend is very passionate about that topic, like I said she wasn't very happy, I was praising feminism but also saying how modern day feminism isn't treated seriously because they are trying to solves issues like manspreading and mansplaining instead of prioritising FGM in countries like Ethiopia and Somalia, I was also saying how it doesn't put enough emphasis on the issues men face in society.

&#x200B;

So my friend got angry and texted me about it, she told me to go ""fuck myself"" and I responded with an ""okie""

&#x200B;

A week passes and I call my other good friend, I told her about the situation (all three of us are very close friends) and i decided to write her an apology, however this time not promising anything as I simply cannot keep my promises (btw i have bipolar and struggle to control and deal with my urges, I sent the apology, and she responded with an ""ok"" this made me realise that she probably didn't even read my message and just thought it was the same old shit of me promising not to do it again, I feel and deep down know that I've lost her trust in me.

&#x200B;

I fucked myself over and really want to apologise without saying ""I'm BiPoLaR, FeEl SoRrY fOr Me"" or basically blaming my condition for what I've done, my friend knows I'm bipolar.

&#x200B;

I've been having suicidal thought since I sent the apology and my fear of abandonment hasn't helped whatsoever, due to me having bipolar...

&#x200B;

Does anyone know how I could talk to my friend in a way where she could understand me, like I said this really isn't the first time and i don't want to sound clingy, pathetic or dramatic, she is also very stubborn so will stick to her point till the very end where she realises she made a real mistake..

&#x200B;

I'm in a really shit place in life where I feel everyone has a deep hatred for me and doesn't want me as their friend, school is also starting back soon after the half-term, I'm 15 about to do my GCSEs.

I feel like I need to share this state of mind of mine somewhere. I'll be as brief as possible

I'm fantasizing way too much over fictional worlds at the moment. I have noticed that my identity is pushing towards something that isn't real. Let me clarify this.

I've been a huge star wars fan for about a year. I have watched all the movies, the tv shows and played all the games that came out since, and read multiple books ( Just to clarify, this problem has also ocurred with another book series I read when I was younger ). I am so submerged into the universe that I start basing a lot of what I do based on the characters from the franchise. It does lead me to do some pretty good things. For example, I started meditating and volunteering, and I hope to become a canadian army pilot or or accomplish an engineering feat that would send us to space, but the problem is that my standards and what I do is based on a fictional world. I feel like I have to do these things to model my favorite characters who are not real and have superpowers. I feel bad whenever I don't have a good workout or a good score on an exam or I don't read on the day. I have a fear of pain and I feel horrible about it because my favorite characters are extremely calm and sharp in front of adversity. I fantasize additional stories in my head in the shower or when I'm taking a walk. I realize this isn't a healthy way to live and I don't want to end up being such a fanatic that I create my own cult or something. For context, I don't have many other hobbies. I really only have 1 friend who I play video games and I used to play football with but that's it. Watching football is the only hobby I do currently that isn't related to Star Wars. I don't go out with friends, I do some digital art but I mostly design star wars ships and characters on there so does it really count. Anyways, Thank you if you've read this far and I know I am not alone on this so if one of you guys can help me or you've seen a post about this sort of state of mind please let me know.

j2nj69,MentalHealthSupport,1601477336.0,"I just want to see if anyone feels the same way. 

I always consider myself as shy and an introvert. Growing up, I would have my mom or my little sister talk to a waiter/waitress at fast-food chains for extra sauce or fork. I would avoid buying stuff on my own if I can't find someone else talking to the seller (especially in Asia, I have to bargain in most markets). That's why since I moved to N.America, I really appreciate the self-ordering machine in McDonald's and the self-checkout at groceries. 

People around me just assume I am shy, and I think so too, but as I am an adult now, whenever I do so, my friends and most of the time now, my boyfriend, would say stop being so shy and speak up, no one is gonna bite me. I know no one is gonna bite me, but it's not just being shy, it's the tight in the chest everytime I realize I have to talk to strangers. I would get nervous and anxious over simple requests. I got better with social interaction now since I worked at resto, so I can deal with shopping on my own and asking waiters in resto now.

But the same shit remains in my social circle. After 3 months or so being at home during COVID, I even got anxious when my friends ask me to hangout. It's not like ""finally I can go out!"", it's more like ""ok, I have to go out with them to maintain our friendships"". It's even worst with the zoom classes I am taking, whenever there's a breakout room to talk to my classmates in a group or 1-1. I freaked out. It felt okay during the convo and after, but it's just the anticipation of that's gonna happen killed me.

hpwpud,MentalHealthSupport,1594569634.0,"I was sittin in the TV room  I tried to get lost in whatever was on. I looked to the corner and sat there was an elderly man. he was thin but had a beer belly that he folded his hands ontop of. His skin was dark and his hair was long and black. I assumed he might be Native American because of the Native American on his t-shirt. I was 23 at the time and a woman.  We were encouraged not to talk to opposite genders. 

A week went by and I noticed him everyday keeping to himself. I had the urge to talk to him everyday but I was worried I would scare him, because I was so manic. But he always had a cool t-shirt like the one before.

 I overheard nurses saying he was in there because he had attempted suicide twice and had no family. ""His neighbor heard the shotgun"" they whispered. After hearing that, I went into the tv room where he was. He was the only one in there. I sat down in a chair. He didnt notice me at all. I looked both ways so to see if any nurses would come in and split us up. I calmly walked toward him. I sat next to him and he looked at me. I asked,

""Hi Im Ashley, what is your name?""
He kept the same expression then turned back to the T.V. and said,

""Joe.""

""Hi Joe, hey I wanted to tell you I love your t- shirts. They remind me of my home in the mountains.""

Suddenly his entire demeanour started to change. He sat up and looked me in the eyes.  I tried to keep eye contact even though i had an incredibly hard time with eye contact. 

This was around the time my meds were kickin in and making me stable. I could actually speak normal speed instead of sounding like a racecar. Racecar spelled backwards is Racecar btw lololol. 

See what i mean...lol

Anyways he said ""oh yeah? Where are you from?"" i told him the BLANK mountains and that I missed living there but I dont anymore.

""Oh thats ok,"" he said, ""we all end up where we are supposed to be. Sometimes happy. Sometimes not"". 

I didnt know how to respond to that without getting too intimate in his history.

I asked, ""do you have kids?""

""Yeah. Grandkids too. Dam I wish I had my wallet. I would show you a picture of em.""

I said it was ok and asked where he was from. ""Oh just a flat land called Oklahoma"". 

I lit up and said, ""wait a minute, your Native American right?"" 

He laughed and said ""what gave it away?"" We both laughed and I asked, 

""Are you Choctaw?""

He looked at me, smiled and said ""I knew you were one too.""

I laughed and said ""im white as the color white! How could you tell?""

""Well young lady, you have very high cheek bones, square jaw, very tall, and a kind spirit.""

I started to get excited because what I was going to say next didnt shock him either.

""My dude, im Chotaw aswell about 1/8.""

""Yeah I know.""

""What? How did you know?""

""We just do. Didn't you have that feeling about me?""

Well i did want to talk to him all week. I was scared I would scare him. Even though before I heard the nurses speaking about him, i just kept in the urge to talk to him. Something did, in fact, pull me to him.

I said, ""Yeah I think so. Man this crazy. I ca2nt believe we are both Choctaw and we met here in this place. Ive never met another Choctaw outside my family.""

We spent the whole day talking. Skipped groups and nurses told me later that they left me and him alone because they were just happy to see him talking. He shared everything about choctaw culture that I didnt know. We got so deep he let me share my traumas to him. I told him everything. I disnt look at him the whole time I talked. 

I said at one point, ""the first man a girl falls in love with is her father. She looks up to him for protection and inspiration. But when I looked up to mine, I saw a demon instead and from there on, I adjusted to a life of terror. The Ironic thing is, the Choctaw comes from his side"".

I looked up at Joey. I looked into his eyes and he was tearing up, trying to hold back.

""You are an amazing woman. No, you are an amazing warrior. Your native tribe is honoured by you.""

We talked more. Then apparently the next day Joey was going to be discharged. He was packed and walking towards the door. He stopped and shuffled through his bag. He pulled out a shirt and gave it to me saying ""this belongs to you"".  It had Native American woman warrior riding a wolf holding a spear with eagles behind her. 

I looked up at Joey and I whispered, ""If you keep fighting for your life, then I will keep fighting for mine."" 

He teared up, and said ""deal"". We shook hands.

I am 33 years old, single, recently unemployed, and living with a roommate who is about as emotionally intelligent as a rock with trust issues. I have a dog, I have seen a therapist every other week since November 2018 (it was weekly before I lost my job and, therefore, my insurance). I have friends, but all but one of them is married (that is not an exaggeration). 

Even on the best of days, before all of this shut the world down, I had a hard time making plans with my friends, and any time I feel the need to reach out I hesitate because I feel like I am a burden to them. This is because I have had to rely on my friends emotional support so much more than the bounds of normal friendship, and they have less time for me because they have their own lives (and I, regretfully, do not).

The quarantine has delivered a few good things for me, mostly silver lining sort of things, but it has also highlighted on the daily just how much I wish was different about my life. Every day I am confronted with my disappointments, failures, and insecurities, and it is getting to be too much. Without going into detail, most of my life has impacted by some very early and unique childhood medical complications, and I only began to really dig into those about 8 years ago. There was a LOT of damage done, and I honestly have my doubts over ever getting to something like a 'normal' life. 

All of that is to say, what the title suggests. Lately, I have been feeling a frustrating mix of loneliness, neediness, hopelessness, resignation, and the distant echoes of the sort of dark thoughts that I would rather not name. Life has left me behind, or so it feels, and I am left feeling empty and hopeless. I am doing everything I know to do to try to fix even just a single issue in my life, but every attempt ends up getting blocked by what feels like a cosmic force that has it out for me (e.g., I was a finalist for a great job that got cancelled due to the virus).

eylbxr,MentalHealthSupport,1580795142.0,"My college freshman son is struggling with his mental health. He is not eating, exercising, self medicating with weed, and prefers not to leave his dorm. In high school, he had self esteem issues but  had all his friends that he grew up with, a safe space. College has been very tough on him and he is struggling with even basic tasks and is very unhappy. He only went back second semester because he said he would be just as unhappy at home. Communication with him is extremely limited, it is just impossible for him to open up.  He did see a therapist twice and concluded the guy was no help and is not interested at this time in talking to anyone else.  I was considering sending him the following message, some of it is for my own mental health to make sure I tell him these things.   
With this background, should I send it? If so, any recommendations on the content?  


  
  

\[Son‚Äôs Name\]

The last couple of times I have seen you, there have been things that were important for me to tell you that I was not able to. Most importantly, I love you more than you will ever know. Since you were born up until right now, there is no person in this world I would rather spend time with. We are so proud that you are our son and there is nothing about you or that you could ever do that will ever change how we feel about you ‚Äì NOTHING.

I know that you feel that we haven‚Äôt taken what you are going through seriously, I wish I could assure you that is not the case.  I apologize if we have been late in seeing this was not a passing phase, but we see the pain that you are in - we can very much see that it is real.  We get to see small glimpses of your life when you are here and we try to understand what you tell us, but we struggle to understand how we can best support you.  We have been in contact with dozens of therapists trying to find someone that is available and that you might be interested in working with and rack our brains about what we can do to help. We believe you.

Lastly, I know it is hard for you to share what is happening with me, but I want you to know that any time that you want to talk, 3 AM, 5 AM, 8 PM whenever, I am ready to listen. I promise not to judge whatever you tell me.   

I can see that you are still fighting for the life you want despite what is happening and I hope you continue to battle. I know you are going to figure out the path through this that works for you and we will be here if you need us - always.

eevsfr,MentalHealthSupport,1577159786.0,"ok, so before i start, background information, im chilean, and in 2010 there was a big earthquake, like a BIG one (the event is called 27F if you want to search about it) and turns out it something very important in my life now.

So, when the earthquake happened i was around five years old, i was sleeping when out of nowhere... this was happening. I remember having to search for my clothes really fast so i could go out the house with my family, being in the living room, watching everything fall down, i remember my dog running away the moment we opened the door, and how the fucking roof and walls were breaking. And... this is kinda silly but is the thing i remember the most, how i was super worried because i didn't have time to put my socks on so i was barefoot on the street (the days after i asked my parents if i could sleep with my socks on so this wouldn't happen again).

Now, after moving to my old house again (where this happened), i started to have something like nightmares, but instead of a dream, i would just wake up in the middle of the night, trembling a lot, and thinking i woke up in the middle of a earthquake. Everytime this happens, instead of like, trying to remember this is not real, i always get up, dress really fast, always forgeting to put shoes on (irrelevant but it feels important for some reason), and run to the living room, then i ask if someone else is feeling the earquake, and obviously they say there wasn't a earthquake and it was just a dream.

This happens at least once a week, and just now i'm making the connections (dumb, i know). I want to ask for help but, in my country, this is just normal, like everyone has had an experience like this, everyone older than 13 has a story about it, and having a ""trauma"" seems like, impossible to me, is like living in a country with big insects and being afraid of them, isn't it something you just get used to?

I think what i'm experiencing is PTSD, but i'm not really sure (it feels kinda offensive to just... say i have a disorder without seeing a profesional first), but... isn't a little too late to feel traumatized? i live in a seismic country, and i have experienced a lot of these 'events', i don't even feel afraid of them anymore.

What should i do? Is there even a point on asking for help? it feels like is just something that will keep happening forever, i mean, we will have another big earthquake some day, and probably i will be here when the time comes, will i get over it if it just keeps going back to me?

this started a year ago where i was feeling down most of the time besides a few outbursts of feeling good. this was also my first year in collegue studying electronic engeenering. I feel that this field doesnt really suit me mainly did to parents pressure. I am more intrested in psycologie pr english (ironic i know).I also inspire to be a song writer and singer or kust a musician in a band. But psycology universities in my country wich is  algeria. my mother says she would kick me out if i picked psycolgy adding immense pressure.everything is hard in unv and because I have no pation for it it makes feel terrible after studying i just hate it . my father after i told him that i might not want to go to college, he said i will go and have no other choice and said that he and my mother had made effort for me to get the best grades and what will people say if i just droped out. those worlds hurt me deeply i feel like i cant even controll my life so i have to do whatever it takes so people wont talk and say that i had a great life and great parents.they also say that studying psycology or english is a usless degree..

since i was young i got good math grades and stuff but wasnt really my pasion. so should i just do something just because i am good at it even if i dont like it. I had to force my self to study that stuff and kept pushing on keeping everything botteled up. my mother would hit me if I dont get perfect grades  even 9 out of 10 wasnt good enough.

she has had a hard childhood in her deffence she had to cary gas barrels when she was young while her perfectly healthy brothers and father sat at home.  she was also hit because of grades. she also had a crazy absuve war veteran father who used to fight with her mother all the time.I am not writing this to paint her as a villan .

recently we had an argument and she said that "" she wishes i was dead rather than talking back to her "" this wasnt the first time she wished i was dead. and when i told her that she has said that before. she said she doesnt regret saying it the first time. because in our old fashion culture children are supposed to accept abuse from parents physical or mental or else they are a bad kid and had no manners.she also said that she raised me and crying everytime i lost weight as a baby because i was born premature only for me to grow up and ddisobey here and call her crazy. wich i shouldnt have said .i said it after she stood next to my head yelling saying that she only gave birth to shitty kids i was silent for a few second but i couldnt take it anymore

since she said that my dark feelings double i feel like the world would be better off without me and  i wouldnt feel so overwelmed and under pressure and hurting all the time if i am dead.

i cut my self for the first time yesterday in the tub and it helped relieve some pent up emotions the cuts werent that deep but it felt like the only alternative to ending my life.

my mind feels cloudy i cant even think or feel straight i only feel mostly negative things and lost of my thoughts are bad.I also get headaches after feeling suicidal

i never thoughts i would be the kind of guy that would self harm or think of killing my self thats why i dont even recognize who i am anymore.

about two hours ago i stood on a ledge above the  train station and thoughts of ending at all there and then but couldnt manage to do it.

i dont know if there are any psycologists around my area because here people dont really take care of their mental health and think that psycologists are for crazy people.wich is why psyclogy is considered usless.

i dont plan in staying in this shithole of a place so i will either end it or leave the house . i plan on living abroad like the uk or smthing.

I wanted to shine some light on this matter because it is a disorder people often confuse with shyness or nervousness.   
Social Anxiety is a disorder also known as social phobia characterized by a strong fear of being judged by others and feeling embarrassed.  
Suma Chand, Ph.D., director of the cognitive behavior therapy program says that people with social anxiety tend to imagine others are superior to them and critical of them and feel they need to behave perfectly in social situations because of it. But they also have a longing for acceptance, and the fear of others' judgment can keep them from finding it.  
Social anxiety disorder consists of much more than the shyness or nervousness many people feel regarding normal social engagements, such as going on a first date or giving a presentation (‚Äústage fright‚Äù).  
The disorder usually starts at the age of 13 and the causes include but are not limited to abuse, genetics, traumatic events, brain structure, and family history.   
Being aware of yourself socially is very important, but being super fearful about it is when it gets categorized under a disorder when it hinders your performance and starts causing you physical symptoms like feeling light-headed and anxiousness, that is when you know it is time to seek the help of a therapist.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthSupport/comments/d97gcy/social_anxiety/,Social Anxiety,,14,0,1.0

cllhld,MentalHealthSupport,1564854030.0,"I have been dealing with severe depression since I was about 18 years old. From the verbal and physical abuse of my parents to my dad being diagnosed with a fatal blood vessel condition and to eventually need 24/7 care to not having many friends that I felt truly wanted me around nor anyone wanting to talk to me and develop a relationship. I feel alone in so many aspects. I don‚Äôt have much support with regards of my brothers helping me with my dads condition to no more family gatherings for holidays to friends that ignore me or make me feel that I don‚Äôt belong and fit in. The one friend I did have that I truly connected with and developed a great relationship I caught feelings for her but wasn‚Äôt mutual and she found out I had feelings so it abruptly ended the friendship. So as I‚Äôm here laying here in one of the biggest lows of my life I feel life is needing to end. It‚Äôs something I‚Äôve contemplated so much and I hate it because if I‚Äôm this alone all the time there is no need for anyone to be too upset with me gone. It would be like any normal day. One of the reasons  that is preventing me right now is the financial burden of my student debt to my family so I am working two jobs to eliminate that debt so no one has to pay for my education. During that time until I get that paid off I‚Äôm going to do good in the world. Smile at people, to be kind to hug those who need it, to donate money to charities or help pay for someone‚Äôs food that doesn‚Äôt have the money for it.

z2l3rb,MentalHealthSupport,1669197385.0,"TW, CW: Depression, anxiety, some suicidal ideation  
I‚Äôd like to¬†share some things weighing heavily on my mind in the hope that I can relieve some by talking to kind strangers in a safe place. So here goes.  
I feel like I‚Äôm slowly fading away and becoming¬†invisible in my own life, watching my once-friends move on and forget me like a ghost.  
There‚Äôs so much noise all the time of people trying to shout and be seen on all these platforms and it feels truly suffocating. And it feels like my friends are too busy to see me, all the time. They‚Äôre all in long-term relationships and never message to catch up, and they‚Äôre rarely free when I message.¬†  
I keep trying to have hope that these fears aren‚Äôt real and it‚Äôs anxiety playing tricks, but the suffocating silence from the people I care most about is stacking up evidence that‚Äôs hard to ignore any longer.  
The person I considered my best friend moved away and when I looked at all the messages for the last six months, I‚Äôm the only one trying to maintain contact.¬†  
Another time, I landed a new and exciting job after uni and invited 50 people to celebrate. 23 people never responded. 11 said maybe. 11 said they were going. 5 people actually came on the night. It took a lot of courage to organise something again after that. But I‚Äôm organising something for my birthday and invited 50 people again, this time with two months notice. So far, only 8 are going. I really, truly, dread how it‚Äôs going to go because one event is unlucky, and two is the cold hard truth that these people actually don‚Äôt care about me.  
I started a podcast and while lots of people congratulated me initially, now the only listener is my mum. It‚Äôs actually pathetic.  
I‚Äôm scared that all these people and friends are giving me signs that they don‚Äôt want to be around me that I‚Äôm failing to read. And that they‚Äôre too kind to cut me off, so they keep ghosting me until the friendship finally fades of its own accord.  
In my day-to-day life, at work and when I do sometimes see people, I¬†laugh and things are okay for a little while. So maybe no one knows anything is wrong. But underneath, I always feel like this. I‚Äôm so exhausted with trying to do my job, my hobbies, catch up with friends, be a good friend, cook dinner, survive, exercise, do my therapy exercises, look on the bright side. Even my psychologist at our last appointment suggested that I seem fine and I might not be¬†getting much out of our visits and to cut back on appointments.  
There are a couple of friends I could talk to, but they have their own mental health issues and I don‚Äôt want to burden them when they have their own demons to fight. And their‚Äôs are usually worse than mine.  
I work as an ecologist in an industry mitigating climate change, and I‚Äôve really given up hope that things can change fast enough for the environment. We‚Äôre just destroying everything, the wrong people have power and any positive change is too slow to fix the¬†catastrophic damage we‚Äôve done. I grieve every day for the trees we rip up, the animals quietly going extinct and the priceless beauty of nature as it dies.  
The world is moving on and I can‚Äôt keep up. I‚Äôm exhausted with trying to summon the passion for living that I once had. I used to be so happy and energetic and had a million hobbies and sports and I wish I could find that person again. I care so much¬†about doing the right things, people and our world. I care so much I‚Äôm constantly ¬†zigzagging between being in pain or feeling¬†nothing at all.  
I‚Äôm tired of being tired. I‚Äôm tired of shouting into a vacuum that sucks the sound from me. I‚Äôm tired of treading water to¬†keep from drowning. I‚Äôm scared that one day I‚Äôll try to end it, because it sounds easier than living right now.  
What did I hope to get out of writing an essay for some strangers on the internet to read? I¬†don‚Äôt know. Catharsis? Maybe I just want to be¬†honest without consequences. Maybe I‚Äôm waiting for someone or the universe to send me a sign that there‚Äôs a reason I‚Äôm here. Maybe I want confirmation bias that I was right that I‚Äôm alone. I just don‚Äôt know.

yrfy0e,MentalHealthSupport,1668089049.0,"My husband has a severe screen addiction. We are talking about 16h+ a day screen time, quit his job to scroll/play on his phone, completely neglects me and his kids, doesn't participate in household, doesn't know what day/month it is, hasn't showered or brushed his teeth in about 4 months, gets very agressive when confronted with any of this, etc. It's bad. 



He doesn't want to get any help, he keeps saying I am mean, and therefore he flees into his phone. He has no problem and I just have to accept who he is. When I ask him to explain why I am mean, he comes up with completely rediculous stuff like ""last week you made me drive to the supermarket"" (yeah, I had Covid and was really unable to go myself and the kids were hungry and we didn't have any food left) But everything he mentions is always way after he started the addiction. I can even believe him when he says that I am mean to him, because I do get frustrated sometimes because I have all the household shores, am raising 6 kids, have to make enough money to keep food on the table, and as if it couldn't get any worse, we were in the middle of a complete renovation when he started ""slipping away"" and now I am doing that alone too. I will try to explain the situation, but I am somewhat emotional, so it might be a little all over the place. I'm sorry, I hope you can bear with me.



I am very busy, and sometimes even resentful, but that's not the problem right now. I want to help him, but I don't know how. This has been going on for about 2 years now, and I can handle it fine on my own. What I can't handle, is that he's getting violent with the kids when they ""bother him"" (play, laugh, exist) and the kids are starting to copy his behavior. This leads to him getting more angry and the kids misbehaving even more. It's a bad spiral, and usually I see it happening when it starts and send him away before it escalates. I never ever hit my kids, and I can't tolerate this behaviour. I have told him that if he touches one of the kids again, I will end him. This conversation did not go well as you can imagine. He retreated to the backyard and he has been sitting outside in the cold for a few weeks now. He comes inside only to eat and sleep. 



So you might say ""problem solved"" but not really. I feel bad. He used to be a great guy, I know he's just very ill right now. But I can't take this much longer. He won't take my offer to get therapy, he doesn't want to go to a clinic, he keeps saying everything is fine. Although he used to be a smart guy, he is unable to hold a conversation anymore. Is it possible that anytime in the near future he'll be back to 'normal'? 



About 15 years ago, he had a rough period too. He got addicted to playstation games, and it was really hard to get him to go to a therapist and get help. He got better and we moved on, I really thought this was in the past. We were moving forward, the last decade was absolutely wonderful. And now this. Is it possible he'll ""get over this"" by himself, without help? Or is professional help/medication unavoidable? Can I do anything to help him? I don't want the kids to loose their father. I know he's suicidal if I don't keep supporting him. He has no family or friends, zo throwing him out of my house would be a 100% death sentence. No doubt about it, he has absolutely no way to survive on his own. He will not seek help, he will just ""get it over with"". After 2 decades, I know him better than himself.



Edot: Oh I have to add we do not live in the USA. We live in France. He's been diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder and borderline personality disorder when he got help 15 years ago. No autism or ADHD (which I suspected back then). I have tried to find ways to get someone admitted in a psychiatric hospital against their will, but that seems to be really really hard. I would need to go to the gp first, and he would need to try to get him to voluntarily accept help before I can get the gp to sign a paper to het him admitted. He will know what I am trying to do and commit suicide long before that process is over.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthSupport/comments/yrfy0e/is_it_possible_to_snap_out_of_addictiondepression/,"is it possible to ""snap out of"" addiction/depression without help?",,13,21,1.0

o6dqjr,MentalHealthSupport,1624457946.0,"I was disharged from a MH ward and provided with a governmentally funded psychologist. Both of them were very passive, the ‚Äúuh-huh‚Äù therapists, as I called them. Every session I had to talk first, I had to come up with a problem to discuss- no order, no plan, just being listened to and receiving rather small advice and some encouragement. 

By no means am I saying that there are no good therapists and psychologists out there and don‚Äôt let this discourage you. This is exactly why I‚Äôm writing this: 

has anyone ever had a therapist that actually helped them? 

if yes, what kind of a person are you and what problems did you address? 

and, if you can answer, 
did you come there with a mental condition (anxiety, situational depression) or simply ‚Äúlife stuff‚Äù?

Some of the points on the topic I came up with relying on personal experience. Feel free to comment agree/ disagree and add to that. 

üî¥  Some people confuse ‚Äúmy therapist and I didn‚Äôt connect‚Äù with ‚Äúmy therapist was unethical and is in it for the wrong reasons‚Äù

üî¥   Therapists are probably not for acute chronic mental illness, that‚Äôs a role for a psychiatrist. However, it should be the therapist‚Äôs responsibility to identify the condition and properly refer the client

üî¥   A therapist shouldn‚Äôt just have the book knowledge. They should be very emotionally and socially intelligent and empathetic. You can certainly develop these qualities if you haven‚Äôt been gifted with them, but I feel like maybe the majority of therapists don‚Äôt realize that

I also just watched a video on the YouTube channel Cam&Fam, in which the blogger said she made a continuous effort to find a good therapist, but ended up ‚Äújust going from one to another, telling her story over and over‚Äù.

Another story. When I was an exchange student in the US, my host mum and I were sent to a therapist to reaolve the strain between us.

krrne7,MentalHealthSupport,1609951666.0,"I‚Äôm so sorry for the long post ahead. 

I just need to get this off my chest now as I feel like I‚Äôm going to burst and cry any second. It‚Äôs almost 1 AM as I‚Äôm typing this and I have no one to talk to, as my family is already asleep. My next therapy appointment is this weekend so this is my only outlet for now. 

It‚Äôs only been 7 days since 2021 started but I‚Äôve been stuck in a depressing loop of waking up, dreading work, being stressed during work, stressing about work and pending work even after office hours, sleeping late then waking up to continue the cycle again.

I‚Äôm really grateful and fortunate to still have a job during this pandemic but lately, my job has taken a toll on my mental health. I‚Äôve been stressed as work keeps piling up and I can‚Äôt keep up. I feel pressured as everything is urgent and I‚Äôm the only one handling it all, as my 2 team mates are still on maternity leave.

I don‚Äôt feel capable to handle all of this work especially as I‚Äôm still quite junior in my workplace. 

I feel pressure because a lot of people are depending on me and I know the stress I feel right now, is nothing compared to the stress they are experiencing because they are in much higher positions.
I really want to help them and do my best for the company, but everything just feels draining right now. I can‚Äôt perform to the best of my ability which leads me to have a lot of pending work. It‚Äôs so frustrating too because due to the big workload, I am unable to put my attention to other tasks and I leave them pending. I‚Äôm scared of the result if I leave them on pending any further. 

I also can‚Äôt afford to take a leave i have a never-ending workload and especially, as I‚Äôm the only one left in our team for now. 

I feel so paralyzed. Even though I know there‚Äôs a lot of work to do, I still worry and worry instead of actually taking action. I feel stuck. 

I wish I can be one of those people who can work under pressure and under tight deadlines. I wish I can be one of those people who can still push through despite challenge in life. I wish I was not beaten up so easily by my problem. I am a weak and anxious person, and that is a fact. 

I just honestly feel so unmotivated and burnt out. It‚Äôs dreadful to do any task, when there‚Äôs so many people depending on you and I can‚Äôt do everything with the limited time and abilities that I have. 

I don‚Äôt know how I am going to get through this. 

I know I just need to suck it up and power through this work, but right now - I just want to wallow in this sadness and self pity....then hopefully get over this slump and actually get it together.

Normal for me is being able to laugh and be happy in general just like everyone else.  The only difference from most is that I will usually feel some sort of unhappy feeling at least once a day.

He died because of his medicine and loneliness. Same year, my ex-boyfriend left me suddenly to live abroad after 4 years spent together because he wasn‚Äôt happy anymore in his life. Then I tried to recover from this two difficult loss. I became closer with my family and friends. I travelled, I tried to launch my illustrator business. Not really a success. I‚Äôm spending my saving money really quickly and it scares me but I‚Äôm determined to prove to everybody that I‚Äôm strong and I can make a living from my passion, all by myself. Here‚Äôs the problem. Because of the covid situation, my ex boyfriend came back, I rejected him at first because I don‚Äôt trust him anymore. Then I let him come back in my life because he gives me attention but I don‚Äôt take it seriously and stay distant. 
My family and friends are putting a lot of pressure on me because of my financial situation, my behavior with my ex and a lot of things that they don‚Äôt approve. All of this happened after my dad accident. 
I start lying a lot about everything because of that. I‚Äôve enough to justify myself everytime so I simply avoid conversation, stop talking to people... I don‚Äôt want to fight anymore. It‚Äôs easy for everybody. I think they have doubt about what‚Äôs going on. I know I‚Äôm not the perfect girl, I‚Äôm doing unwell but I‚Äôm so tired of being judge, being liable, listening everyone point of view... sometimes, I just want to vanish. 
Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôm not depressed anymore, I‚Äôm ok but I‚Äôm scared to do anything because all my choice looks like bad decision, bad moves.. 
I don‚Äôt know how to explain the situation really.

Anyway, I‚Äôll try my best to make things get better.

Edit 2: Thing evolved, not better, not worst but it‚Äôs different. I found out my ex boyfriend still a piece of shit, I went trough his facebook messages and find out he still chasing girls. It was wise to me keeping distant. He doesn‚Äôt know I saw his conversations. I‚Äôll see later if I confront him or if I just disappear, either way, I must stop this nonsense. About my family, I‚Äôm getting more confident talking to them and keep them out of my privacy and life choices. Still difficult but improving, in some way. Christmas times helping, I‚Äôll see.

trigger warning s\*icide

So I(18F) live in the us but my family are all immigrants. The culture is very collectivist while the us is more individualistic. 

So my grandmother lives with my aunt, uncle, and 2 cousins (and occasionally my grandfather) in a small, crowded and not well maintained house. My grandmother doesnt really do much during the day, just lays down either on the bed or couch from what I see, and watches tv/talks to friends. I feel like that is not healthy for her especially since she always complains that's that people don't visit her. I know it isn't really possible with covid, but I always wished she would join bingo or some kind of activity to give her something to do and socialization, but it just doesn't happen. 

In the past she has said some vaguely s\*cidal things. I am worried for her especially now because my grandfather has recently passed away. Recently she has started saying that she has nothing to live for without him. My parents just tell her to stop speaking saying those things, as if it will stop her being depressed, or feeling like that.

For context, they have been together since they were teenagers. They have 6 kids together and 4 affair kids from my grandfathers cheating, but nobody really nurtures her. I personally don't have much of a relationship with them, every time I see them it's ""how are you, how's school"" and that's about the extent of the conversation, I've never had that typical grandparents spoiling type relationship. I have tried to call her recently just to keep her company a little since she complains that I don't, even though she doesn't call me at all. We live about 20 minutes away, which isn't far at all, but enough that my parents didn't visit often until recently (after my grandfathers death). I don't know if my parents will keep it up though.

I feel like we need to do more for her, but I don't know what. They wouldn't be open to therapy, so professional help isn't really an option. Are there ways we can support her more?

I'm lucky enough to survive in this world and have basic needs yet I'm not satisfied and motivated to do anything with the life that I have. This is making me hate myself.

I feel like whatever I try to do in my life, it will never be enough. I don't have any skill I excel at but I'm trying my best to at least be good at drawing and/or writing during my free time.

Now that our online classes started, I feel like it's taking my time away from doing the things I finally found interesting and makes me excited to get up in the morning. This is one of the reasons why I don't like school but I would feel guilty everytime I have that thought. I am given an opportunity to learn and yet here I am whining like a spoiled child asking for attention. After having this thought, I would hate myself again and then hate myself for hating myself and wish to just disappear.

I would always try to look at where this negative cycle of feelings originated from but no matter how I look at it, it always have been myself to blame even if other people have not treated me in the best possible way. I'm quite relieved that they have the patience to be around someone like me.

I wish I could just laugh at this feelings and shake it off like nothing. I tried to do that and it makes me feel unbelievably light in my chest but it doesn't work everytime especially when everything becomes so heavy that I can't shake it off anymore.

It happened earlier when I made a few mistakes while I'm completing some schoolworks. I spent a lot of time trying to make the answers to the activities as perfect as I can. I ended up using too much of my time and found out later that I misunderstood the instructions of the activity when I had already submitted the schoolwork. I figured that I could have just made everything simple instead of using my time trying out to find answers to anything that could relate to the schoolwork even though it's not necessary. I wasted a lot of time that I could have used to the things I'm interested in. This made me hate myself even more.

I tried to keep a positive mind but I always come back to this state. On one moment or in some days, I would have this colorful view on the world. Everything would be filled with sunshines and rainbows but it doesn't feel like myself. That way of thinking makes me feel like a different person. It gives me the feeling that something is not right then I will switch back to my usual state, which strangely feels more like me even though I'm aware that I'm hurting myself by my own thoughts.

He doesn't like to do much either. My dad passed away over a year ago and my mom remarried 6 months ago. My mom's husband wants to spend every minute with my mom, and he has even told me that he thinks God wants them to be constantly together. What bullshit. Anyways, I work with my brother at varying times most weekdays but my mom/stepdad (as much as I hate that word) require that I work 100% a full two days every week. It isn't the work that bothers me or my brother. He's not even very hard to take care of tbh most of the time. It's the way my mom/stepdad mostly isolate me on those days. I strongly think it was the stepdad's idea b/c it wasn't like this before. They will barely even talk to me at all or anything. They say they ""need their complete break from him"". But they can't seem to get through their heads that they are always together and have each other constantly for company/support and I have to go w/o that for 2 days straight every week. I'm sure at least some people would think this is nothing but I am in so much emotional turmoil. I have been anxious and depressed and am scared I might be having a nervous breakdown or something. It is at the point now where I want to cry all the time at home and am scared to even be home. I just visited my bf (25M) who lives 2 hours away and I notice I don't really even get a trace of anxiety/depression there but when I get home it comes right back to stay until I leave. It feels like hell. I'm honestly scared I might break any moment and have to go to a mental hospital or something. My mom feels bad that I cry so much and am miserable but still is ignorant about what they're doing to me. My stepdad basically just cares about having his 2 days of total alone time with my mom and thinks I just want attention or to escape responsibilities. He even mostly wants to be alone with my mom on most other days too. I make $20 an hour at my job but idk if it's worth it anymore. I pay $900 per month in rent. My stepdad has no job or income. He is not trying to find any either. He just wants to mooch off us and be with my mom every damn second like it's his right. Please help, thank you...

ido1k5,MentalHealthSupport,1597975879.0,"Ever since I can remember, my dad has always been a yeller. But i was little then, and I just thought that because he used to be in the military, and was a cop (at the time), that it is probably because of that. Now that I'm a little older (15) I can realize stuff now, and I feel like I'm being mentally abused by him.

I want to say first off that I'm not saying he is a bad father. He has worked his ass off to provide for our family. I live in a good house, I go to a catholic school, I eat good. I know, what is this kid complaining about, he has a privilege that most don't, he shouldn't be complaining. But here is the thing, I would rather live in a shitty home, go to a public school, and have nothing, if he wasn't the way he was. If he wasn't how he is now, and how he treats me, I would rather have nothing, because I would be happy that he shows me the amount of affection I see other kids get. If I were to tell him that, he would tell me the list would go on and on about the things he has done for me, but I dont care about the money that he spent on me. That isnt love.

I have a few reasons on why I think what I do

1. He is always yelling or getting mad at everything everyone does in the house: He yells if people have to ask him to repeat something more than once(When he constantly does that.) He will yell at you and be mad at you if you forget something(When that is something he is constantly doing.) 
2. He is always suspicious and thinks that we are all lying to him: It makes me feel like I'm never trusted.
3. He brings me down and it makes me change the way I am: He has called me a ""fag"" for the way I used to part my hair, so I started to change the way I was doing my hair, (for my entire life up to when i was 12 when he called me that) He has made fun of the way my jaw is shaped, and I feel like I can never have a good picture now, because it is all I see, and I want to change it so he doesn't think that way
4. I am always the one who is wrong in everything because, ""he is older than me"": I was told by him, ""Whether you like it or not, your always gonna lose."" And it makes me feel like everything is my fault. I am always apologizing for everything, even with things that I shouldn't apologize for. My girlfriend tells me that I say sorry too often.
5. He lies to make himself right in situations: Just the other day, I made myself food, and I didnt know he wanted anything. I told him, ""I can go back upstairs and make you something, because I didnt know you wanted anything."" But he wouldnt let me. He ends up waking up my mother, who is asleep, and asks her to make him food, because I refused to make him any. And I cant say anything because I know, ""I'm always going to lose.""

I feel like I have so much anxiety for no reason. I woke up having an anxiety attack in the middle of the night one time after he yelled at me that for something. But I cant say anything because, ""I'm always going to lose."" He tells me I have anxiety for reason, and that I have nothing to have anxiety about. But what he doesnt understand is that I have anxiety because I am always worried that Im going to get yelled for everything.

I tell my mom how I feel, and all she can tell me is, ""Forget about the things he's done."" But she doesnt understand that it is hard to, because ive experience it my entire life. I cant just, forget about the past and POOF its gone. But she doesnt understand thats not how it works.

I cant have a conversation with him about it because, ""I'm always going to lose""

My mom tells me that I just have to deal with it until I move out. But I dont know when that will be, and i cant be living in an environment where I am always wrong, I cant be trusted, and that I cant do anything about because, ""Im always gonna lose."" She tells me that I cant talk to a therapist, or a priest about it, until I move out, because he isnt gonna let me talk about the shit he has done, to someone else. But I NEED SOMEONE NOW,not in 10 years, I need someone to talk about how I feel now. So I feel like this is a good place to get some advice. I just hope that my dad doesnt see this, because I'm gonna feel like the worst person in the world",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthSupport/comments/ido1k5/i_feel_like_im_being_mentally_abused_by_my_father/,I feel like im being mentally abused by my father,,13,7,0.94

I find the whole therapy concept super intimidating and kind of terrifying but I feel more terrified of my headspace and even more terrified that I'm getting worse. Right now I am capable of convincing myself to get help and if I wait another week or two, I don't know if I'll be able to. I read that journaling when you're at your worst helps you recognize that you need help when you are not at your worst but I just feel so pathetic and helpless whenever I read my entries, I don't know though, maybe it's just me.

If anyone has advice for this week and for someone starting therapy that they would like to offer, I would greatly appreciate it. I'm planning on bringing my journal, tissues, and a pen. My partner is taking me to and from the appointment so I won't need to worry about like breaking down behind the wheel (which I, unfortunately, have done before, no accidents but it made the situation worse) and then we are going to make banana bread or go out for ice cream, or something else.

I‚Äôm a stay at home mom to a 2.5 year old and a 1 year old. Most responsibilities are on me. I left a job that I loved and moved 3 hours away from everyone I know for my husbands job. I‚Äôm alone most of the time. When I‚Äôm not alone, I‚Äôm with my husband or his parents. I‚Äôm often told that I‚Äôm crazy, I talk to much, I‚Äôm annoying or bizarre. Comments are made about the state of my house if literally anything is out of place (the house is 600 square feet. I have 2 kids. It‚Äôs never dirty but toys make their way to every room and it‚Äôs hard to keep up on laundry without a washer dryer. Other than that, the house is cleaned all day everyday. )

I‚Äôm tired of being told that I‚Äôm crazy but if I go on medication I‚Äôm treated like I‚Äôm weak. I‚Äôm tired of being alone and dismissed everytime I try to talk about how I‚Äôm feeling. I‚Äôm tired of finally being in a good mood and then told that I‚Äôm being annoying. 

I don‚Äôt have a career and I don‚Äôt have a degree. After my kids start school I will be stuck in a retail/waitressing job. I don‚Äôt want to take out any more loans because we are already 100k in debt for my husbands schooling. I don‚Äôt feel like I‚Äôm a good role model for my kids and I just want to lay around and let them watch YouTube. They are unsocialized and I‚Äôm lazy. 

I‚Äôve thought about checking into a mental hospital but I don‚Äôt know what to do with my kids. I also don‚Äôt want to be seen as ‚Äúthe crazy woman that finally broke‚Äù.  The mental health institutions also have horrible reviews so I‚Äôm scared that it‚Äôll be an awful experience.

cqt64k,MentalHealthSupport,1565890819.0,"Hi

I hope some of you guys see this & read it. I don‚Äôt really know where I‚Äôm going with this post as I type it, but basically I‚Äôve just now realized the mental health issues affecting my family, myself, and that I should seek help for them. It‚Äôs gonna be long but I just wanna get some thoughts down in word & hopefully I can get your guys‚Äô support.

My family as a history of mental illness. I never really knew mental illness could be hereditary until the hornets nest of mental problems affecting my family was revealed to me.

My extended family consists of about 22 people, and half of them have either a clear mental/emotional problem, traumatic emotional experience, and a couple that seem to be on the autism spectrum, from both family sides. Granted, only one or two of these are diagnosed, but it‚Äôs very obvious even in undiagnosed people. Also, this is only what I know, and I sure as hell don‚Äôt know everything about my family, and I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if there were more. 

I‚Äôm almost 10 years younger than both of my siblings, so I was always in the dark about their childhood experiences & about our family history, until recently, when me and my sibling discussed in depth this shaky mental history. We‚Äôd always known it but never ever talked about it: we were emotionally abused growing up. I feel like a lot of focus gets put on physical abuse, but the emotional abuse was real & the psychological effects are lasting in all of us. 

Now that I‚Äôve come to terms with this, I want to seek help. I know I am socially anxious & intensely paranoid, but I don‚Äôt know if I HAVE anxiety & paranoia, know what I mean? I know I often feel depressed, but I‚Äôm unclear if I HAVE depression. and I think going to a mental health counselor will help me understand my own mind better, and improve on my emotional problems. I can find out if I should seek diagnosis & further medical help.

That‚Äôs about it. Thanks for reading all that. Like I said, I don‚Äôt really know the point of this post. I guess I just wanna find a community of people like me. 

Do any of you see this same mental illness pattern in your families? What are your stories regarding your families? What do you know about mental health heredity? What about trauma? Can a parents trauma be passed down to their children? Also, how has seeking psychiatric counseling helped you guys?

I have no friends to talk to or share any personal and deep stuff with. I need someone whom I can talk with without judging me, someone who is willing to listen. But it has to be from my same gender (females) because it will be easier (for me) to talk with and to get closer to. That someone needs to respond to my texts and my calls too (we will use any social app that allows us to make calls without fees) that someone have to truly care about me and what I say. Without any faking. That person also needs to have interests like mine (so it is easier for us to talk) Arts, Literature, Books, psychology, anime, manga, bl, films and tv shows, Writing, or anything close.

Barely stabilised when I found out I was pregnant and had to come off all the meds.

So I'm using non-medical methods of tackling the depression. Yesterday I finished building a ""grass run"" for my rabbits and was pleased that they enjoyed it. There's still a few tweaks needed (as the video at the bottom shows, my fat rabbit can get his head out at the corner of the gate).

Proud of my achievement, I posted about it to r/pets and thought nothing else of it. I mentioned that my Rabbits had fun on the grass and my dog had fun chasing them.

Enter keyboard warriors criticising me for letting my dog chase them. She's outside the run, they're inside, she can't harm them accidentally, and they're not afraid of her because their main run is outside too and they're used to her.

Even after giving context, however, and showing the video below, they still kept up with the criticism and down-voting of any comment providing context.

FFS, it's not like I tossed them in with a dog they didn't know!

The dog and the black rabbit are actually besties. The white rabbit isn't besties with the dog, but he's not scared of her either (as this video CLEARLY shows).

It ruined my morning. I'm sick to death of keyboard warriors shitting on people.

nythkm,MentalHealthSupport,1623580114.0,"I've been treated by mental health professionals since I was 8, it's been almost 16 years now with 14 therapists and 12 psychiatrists. 30+ different meds easy, none worked or if they did the side effects were horrible. 

I have SMI status which means I get healthcare for free from the state because I'm Seriously Mentally Ill (SMI) but I have to go to government funded clinics. 

The clinic I have had since I got SMI has been horrible. The PCP commits insurance fraud and doesn't even do her job. The turn around on the staff is insane. They can't keep anyone longer than a year, so I'm never getting stable care. 

I've done all the normal therapies, CBT, DBT, ACT, etc. And none have worked. DBT was so bad for me I ended up in the hospital twice. Never happened before or since. I was trying to get EMDR but everywhere makes me go through their DBT program first which I won't do for obvious reasons. So they deny me. 

The therapists never really do anything. Again they never last more than a year and even the best ones I've had don't even bother to remember my family members names (people I talk about very often in therapy). They just sit there invalidating me, telling me I'm wrong, making disgusted faces when I talk about difficult things, accusing me of making things up or not trying hard enough, or the most common reason for ending the sessions is ""I don't think I can help you, hopefully you can find someone better equipped."" 

So right now I'm trying to get in to see a Neuropsychologist and see if they can figure more out. Then I'm hoping that my insurance will pay for TMS and if it doesn't I need to hope I can get disability and get the back pay and pay the $10k for the TMS. But if the TMS doesn't work, or worse, does work then stops after a while, I won't be able to get it again, and the money will have been a waste. 

I'm also trying to get ketamine therapy but idk if that will work out. 

And after that it's mushrooms. 

I don't know what to do anymore. I'm reaching the end of my list of options and I still have gotten no relief. What else should I do/look into? 


TL;DR I suffer from anxiety, depression, BPD, and PTSD. I've been in the mental health field for 16y as a patient. Tried all the usual stuff. Received no relief. My current plan is try and get TMS, then ketamine, then mushrooms if that all doesn't work. Beyond that idk, does anyone have ideas?

I have basically spent over half of my life indoors, for the past decade I have actively avoided going outside, I used to sit with my curtains closed all day & I would just never move, it was like I was paralysed for a very very long time. I‚Äôd get up for school and college etc, but I was very miserable and would miss days, wake up late and was never engaged in school whatsoever. I‚Äôm 21 now, recently got engaged, I‚Äôm trying my best to improve for my new family because I never wanted to live inside for the rest of my life to begin with and I feel like this is my way out, but I‚Äôm so stuck !!! I don‚Äôt even feel like a person sometimes. For context, I come from a very abusive background, my mother was young when she had me and my siblings, she never wanted kids to begin with and suffers with pretty bad mental illness that she isn‚Äôt even diagnosed with bc she just avoids all of her problems and stays abusive bc she was abused and wants the power now I guess ? I‚Äôve had a v hard life, I have never rlly had a home until now and never had a real family until now. I‚Äôve suffered with lots of other traumas before and due to this trash past I have depression, anxiety, histrionic personality disorder and complex ptsd, I struggle daily. I have barely any emotional stability and it took me YEARS to be just a little bit more stable in that sense. I was v neglected, never got taught how to clean, how to hold cutlery, how to tell the time, how to comprehend normal things, sometimes I feel like my emotional level is just paused and I‚Äôm not growing ? I get irrational and enraged over very minor things, I‚Äôve been trying to read books that relate to my illnesses but I struggle to focus on things due to suspected ADD. 

I never got any treatment for my problems when I was a child either so I am only very recently diagnosed with things and I‚Äôm still just trying to find out who I am as a person, I can‚Äôt connect with anything at all unless it‚Äôs another traumatised person or an animal, I rarely like anything and if I do I forget about it rlly quickly, I also feel like I‚Äôm on pause if I‚Äôm not doing anything. It can feel like I‚Äôve been looking at a wall for 2 minutes and in reality it‚Äôs been 2 hours. 

I‚Äôm on sertraline and have been trying to seek help for my issues for a long time, I just keep getting put onto very long waiting lists

I want to know how I can just focus on things, how to be more ‚Äúconscious‚Äù I guess ? I want to be good at things or at least one thing, I want interests and hobbies and things to talk about, I struggle to find friends because who tf would be friends with just an empty shell. 

All I felt for like 10 years was rage, complete sadness and ‚Äúmeh‚Äù idk how to function in society?? 

I have a rlly bad vitamin d deficiency from getting no sun, my bones are very weak sometimes, I‚Äôve hopped down from a step before and ended up in the hospital because I badly sprained my ankle from it, I‚Äôve had to figure everything out by myself for so long and now I‚Äôm just emotionally drained. I don‚Äôt have to constantly look for ways to survive anymore bc my fianc√© takes care of me and now I feel like I have nothing to do ??

gnl5in,MentalHealthSupport,1590015802.0,"I'm just going to ramble in whatever order things come to mind. I've always found it easier to open up to strangers and I'm really not sure why. Anyways, I'm just going to get right into this. I just... I really wish we weren't in quarantine because I need a hug from my friends right now more than I have ever needed it. I tend to hold things in and bottle up my emotions and I just don't know how to open up to the people closest to me. I've been dealing with a lot of stuff and it's just eating me up. I think I have depression, but I've never been medically diagnosed because I'm too afraid to bring it up to my parents. I already feel like a failure and I just think it'll make it worse. 

I've never really had much in common with either of them, or any of my family. Hell, my friend group has barely anything in common, but I guess that's why we're so close, even though it doesn't make sense. I've been bullied since I was four years old. I've never fit in, and I own my identity so it makes me stick out even more, and if you stick out people want to pull you back in. But I'm stubborn. I won't change unless I think that I need to, and even then it's hard. I was an easy target for bullies, and still am since I don't have a way to fight back. I'm not witty with comebacks, I can't ignore injustice, and if I fight back physically I'd get blamed since I'm taller than everyone else. It was so hard to deal with that, especially because I feel so alone all the time. Eventually I felt so helpless and angry because I was getting bullied that I felt like I had to do something, and that's when I found out that I wasn't allowed to push people or hit people even if they broke me down to the point where I felt I had to. Looking back, I'm extremely regretful and shameful because I feel like I shouldn't have, but I also understand that I felt truly helpless. The worst part was that even now, simply because of how I've been raised, I try to see the good in every single person that bullied me, which causes so much inner turmoil since I feel like I should forgive them, but I just can't let go. I was made fun of for being Indian, for being proud of my heritage, for being a nerd, for being fat, for my handwriting, for how I talk, or the things I did, and so much more. And it wasn't just one or two people. I faced it from family-friends, from other students at my school, I get sideways looks walking down a street, and it's just not fair. I try my best to be nice to EVERYONE, and if I hurt someone's feelings I immediately apologize. But maybe that's why people walk all over me, because I let them. The worst part is that I haven't felt like I was able to talk about it but now I just need to. After this, I  lost so many people and it hurts so much. First, my great grandfather passed away. We all knew it was coming but it still hurts, and I feel guilty because I don't know how to get to know my grandparents, and I'm in general really awkward so I'm scared I'll barely know them (my grandparents) when it's their time too, but I never even try to get to know them better. I lost my uncle because he lost his job, and got so depressed that he drank himself to death. That hurt me even more because it was the first time I saw my mother cry. That just broke me. Then last year, I lost my best friend. I loved her like a sister and I've thought about her every single day. I even remember her smile and laugh, and I miss them so so much. Everything got too much for me and I started procrastinating, which made my parents extremely disappointed because it's so bad that I don't even care if I fail this year. I feel like I need to open up to them but I just can't. I feel like a failure. A useless piece of trash. I've been suicidal for 3 years, but I've been saved by dumb luck. A random text from someone, my parents coming home, stuff like that. I have so much work to do right now, and I want to do it so I don't disappoint my mom even more, but I just can't muster the willpower to do it. I need help but I don't know how to tell them that. I almost never cry, and I think that that's really concerning. I'm actually proud of myself for letting it all out while I write this. The worst thing is that I'm going to downplay this tomorrow, and chalk it up to me overacting or something stupid. Even if I don't do my homework, I lie to my parents about it and I just feel awful. I think that I'll get to it later, but later never comes. My mom has a short temper. She's never hit me, but she get really angry, especially if I lie, and that makes it worse. I was called a terrorist in fifth grade. That was the first time I ever noticed racism and it scared me. I was in so much shock that I didn't even respond to the comment. Looking back, I should've punched him, even if there was a consequence, it'd be worth it. Honestly, this helped me a lot more than I though it would.

Excuse me if this is the wrong sub. I just had an attack and wanted to get this out there, with other people. Just to get heard and hope you speak your mind.

I try to be as grateful as I can be because I love (my) life. Other people might deserve more attention than me. But I still hope there is somebody out there with wisdom.

Attack description: lost in deep thought, profound and throughout realisation of being mortal. I instantly make the comparison between the now (doing whatever) and the next now that will be forever being dead sometime. The conformation of time flowing one direction only and going towards being dead hits me. I get stuck in this realisation, in this imagining myself being dead state. It terrifies me. I want to run towards my mom or my good friend. I physically get up to start running wherever I am. Only to realise nobody can help me and everybody is in the same boat.

Frequency: almost never in the last years. Had them regularly years ago. Got surprised by it today and decided to write it down.


Something about me, I can let go. I made tedious puzzles before to only smash them back into the box. Lost old photos or mistakes I made or whatever, I can let go. I don't own little enough to call myself a minimalist, but don't consume or own enough to call me average either. 

I'm not looking for a meaning in life, Im happy with my own interpretation. I don't know what to expect with this post since no one has answers.. I'll just try to go to sleep, enjoy life again and let go.

epy98s,MentalHealthSupport,1579253823.0,"Hey y'all. This is my first post on here so I apologize if I break any rules. I did read them to be safe but I just wanted to throw that in just in case.

I am a 36 year old woman who has had 3 children. My oldest (may my sweet girl RIP) would have been 19 next march and my youngest just turned 12. I did not have very many symptoms until after I had my first Angel but they really hit hard and all at one time. Also, she passed away st 6 weeks old which is pain I will never stop feeling. I have just learned to do the best I can but there is no way to ever not feel the loss of a child IMO. About 2 years after she was born, (she had passed a year and 8 months before this as well) I  was diagnosed with Bipolar type 1, Schizo effective disorder and severe GAD. It was vary hard dealing with those and being a new mom of an Angel and I always prayed it was severe PPD and depression from burying my babygirl and it would go away but sadly that didn't happen.

I do feel blessed that I have never had severe issues with the School effective disorder like many other have to deal with. For many years, it was just  auditory hillusinations and paranoia where I always think people are staring and talking about me but for the past 5 years or so, the voice (its always been just the one male voice but the things he says are beyond terrible. (I would imagine anyone who suffers with any form of hallucinations, especially visual ones. That would horrify me) about 5 or so years ago it seemed like all three of my diagnoses became 1,000 times more severe at the same time and I have no idea why.

OK want to add that I am a heroin addict who has been in recovery for 8 years now which I sure has to have something to do with it but why didn't it start until after 3 years of sobriety? I take 1200 mg of Lithium a day, They upped my Depekote from 250 mg to 500 mg extended release and also put me on 2 mg of Klonopin 3 times a day but nothing is getting better and I am so lost and feel so hopeless and have no idea what to do! I am uninsured so I go to a clinic that has sliding scale fees and normally they are still very good doctors but sadly the only I see now doesn't listen to me at all. For months I have stayed in a bad anxious state where I just know something is really wrong but don't know what is and can never figure out what it is and the panic attacks have become so severe that I have called the EMTs at least 10 times in a month. Even though I have felt the same feeling for over 16 years, each one is still  terrifying because of how fast my heart rate gets and how high my blood pressure gets and this happens while taking  total of 6 mg of anxiety. I honestly believe that they need to either add another type of med or adjust the dose I am on. I have barely slept on months because the voice has gotten so loud and so constant that it keeps me awake. If there are any Supernatural fans in here, it feels so much like what Sam went through when Cas broke down the wall in his brain making him go insane from his time in the Cage and he was constantly Hallucinating that Luci was with him st all times, singing or throwing those poppers on the ground all night which caused him to almost doe from lack of sleep. 

I am honestly not sure why exactly I am posting this but K just got such a strong urge to vent to people who truly understand. My husband is the only person I have who is by my side all all times and doesn't say rude and hurtful shit like I am just being dramatic and overreacting and I should be a strong enough person to not panic.

ejihu1,MentalHealthSupport,1578072089.0,"Hi everyone. My name is Isa and I‚Äôm 16. I don‚Äôt want this explanation to be super lengthy so here‚Äôs the short version:

In 2018 I reconnected with a friend I had met when I was super little. We weren‚Äôt super close before but we quickly became best friends. We were inseparable. We did everything together. He was my world. 

Earlier this year he spontaneously decided he didn‚Äôt want to be friends with me anymore and did some real low stuff to ‚Äúget rid of me.‚Äù To put it in short this boy. Fucked. Me. Over. It‚Äôs taken me a good 8 months to really get back to a stable place after this. What he did was a little traumatic. 

I haven‚Äôt seen him since March of this year. In the next week and a half there‚Äôs a winter dance I want to go to. I found out that he‚Äôs going to be there. After learning this I wasn‚Äôt going to go, but I really do want to have fun with my friends. I‚Äôm not going to the dance with anyone specifically, but with two people in my inner circle. 

I‚Äôm prone to panic/anxiety attacks in situations where I know I will be anxious. I‚Äôve never been to therapy before (I refuse to go. I‚Äôm stubborn, I know) so I have no experience with coping mechanisms and tips/tricks to use to mentally and emotionally prepare myself beforehand, and what to do while in the middle of these anxious situations. 

What are some basic things I can do to help myself prepare in the coming week before I see him, and while I‚Äôm there if I happen to panic or something like that?

Instead of self-harming (cutting, stabbing, hitting...etc), grab two ice cubes and put one in each palm and squeeze as hard as you can. This will be painful, but it will also give you the relief that you're looking for when you go to self-harm and it won't leave you with a scar.

Obviously, for those of you that want a visible marker of your pain and you self-harm for those reasons as well as just the pain aspect, the ice cube trick won't give you that visual marker. But it might be worth a try next time you want to self-harm.

cego7x,MentalHealthSupport,1563387765.0,"I've been on Zoloft for over a year and over the last two weeks, I stopped taking it. Not because I was told to or because I told myself that I was better and didn't need it anymore...I've just gotten out of the habit and kinda forget on a regular basis.

Being off of it has made me realize a few things. First, I'm actively observing a manic episode beginning to blossom and it's bizarre, but in a way it's almost a refreshing change of pace from the pathetic nothingness I feel on the Zoloft. I actually wrote an entire chapter of a story this week after struggling for months to write anything at all. I've gotten more done at work. My brain seems to be processing things more clearly instead of like it exists in a constant fog.

On the other hand, I'm also more emotionally volatile and get explosively angry at things. Not people, really, just life in general. I've been a lot more blunt and catty to people if they annoy me instead of just dealing with their bullshit. I also feel a lot more...not suicidal, really. I don't want to actively kill myself. But I am having a lot of ""lol I want to die"" thoughts. I had them on Zoloft, too, but I could usually just watch Netflix or something and ignore it. Now it seems a lot...louder? Idk.

I feel like none of this is healthy. Being off the drugs clearly isn't the way to go, but I also don't think I'm supposed to feel the way I do when I *am* on the Zoloft. Like it doesn't make me happy or even good, really. It just makes me feel so numb that escapism is way easier. It's just kinda fucked up and hilarious to me that I don't even know what I'm supposed to feel like to be considered okay.

But one symptom is just holding me and won't let go. The feeling of the tightened throat. Which makes me feel like I can't breath. Which makes me cough. Which leads to almost puking! Now it is like ok because I'm at home so I have that little scene, than I slow down or stop whatever I'm doing (including just walking or talking) and after I force myself to unclench my teeth I breath it through and after a while I'm good for few hours before it repeats. But I don't know how would I cope when I'm in public. The thought it will keep happening to me when I'm back to work is not good. Or worse if I would not be able to contain myself and go ahead with vomiting...

yfroj7,MentalHealthSupport,1666971782.0,"Hi. I‚Äôm (24f) and this is my story. Growing up I had the most loving and supportive parents. They meant the world to me and still do especially my mum. She told me numerous time that I am her pride and joy as I was the baby she worked so hard for as she had numerous miscarriages before she ultimately had me. Don‚Äôt misunderstand as she still eqully love my only younger sibling (22m) the same. What my parents doesn‚Äôt know is that when I was a child (around 7 years old) I was sexually molested by a family member and again by a different family member again at 12 years old. I have never struggled with this till I graduated high school. I think the hectic life off high school didn‚Äôt leave enough time for me to process anything that happened to ke prior but it was at the back if my mind especially when I see my friends get boyfriends and love interest while I am too scared to try to reciprocate any feelings.

I did some part time jobs throughout my univeristy life and the men in power at certain places at work (not all) has been trash. I think that was what triggered my mental health spiral. Going through university has been life changing to say the least. Maybe I‚Äôm being dramatic, but it was a huge change. I‚Äôm an introvert and I was in a community where I was the 1% minority and had trouble connecting with other people and my university life was very depressed. I only had 3 friends my entire university life and even I know that they would not rather be friends with me. I just kinda latched on. 

I was severely depressed my entire 2 years in university. My grades took the most impact and I was spiralling so deep that I started self harming myself and even trying to kill myself 3 times. It was a dark moment for me. This scared me so much that I reached out for help from my mum. Just for info my mum is a psychologist and she helped me with a therapist and I have been meeting with for two years. I got meds and got diagnosed with BPD. When I first started the meds, I was content. For the first timw in a long time I managed to get some decent sleep. However, in the long run, meds isn‚Äôt the solution to everything I feel.

Fast forward to 2022, I am definitely milestones away from where I started and I am happy to say I managed to pull myself from my slump and graduated albeit a semester delay. I also stopped self harming and getting better slowly. Recently however, my mum asked me if I am alright and if I was still depressed and if I would mind sharing what I was going through with her. She knows my diagnosis and the meds I take but she doesnt know how bad my depression affects me till this day. I haven‚Äôt shared about the abuse that happened and honeslty if you asked me2-3 years ago I would say its a secret I would take to the grave. But now I‚Äôm not sure. Sometimes I feel so much resentment that all I can do is cry at how helpless and misreable I ak gonna be for the rest of my life. I want to scream at the world, why me? Fuck it, why me? I even have issues on days when my mum would ask me whats‚Äôs wrong. All I want to say is its your fault I am like this but I know its not and not fair to blame it on them. Do any of u have any advice on this?

But in the last year, I conquered my fear to brush my teeth, established a routine, and even went to the dentist. I worked hard on another panic response to a daily trigger and got it under control. I practiced my methods and skills. When I have a low I keep away from things that would make it worse and do the stuff that helps to make it shorter even if it needs a lot of strength. I started studying again and discovered my extroverted site that got buried under social phobia for years.

I got through the extremely long and difficult process of diagnosing my ADHD and gonna start medication next week. I'm starting therapy again. I never felt so stable at any point in my life but it is constant hard work. I take care of my bills and important phone calls most of the time instead of ignoring them until it's too late.

I‚Äôve been stuck in that place in my life for a very long time, but now I am finally putting the work into turning my life around.

For many years I have been stuck in the same unhealthy pattern and environment, involving mental illness, alcohol abuse and everything that follows. I was recently hospitalized in the psychiatric award, after a psychotic episode while drinking, followed up by suicidal tendencies. And only then, I discovered that I had to remove myself from everything I knew, if I ever wanted to get better.

In that context I decided to create a youtube channel, sharing my journey towards getting a better life. And I really hope that It can help someone start making the changes they need for them self! 
Which is why I wanted to share it with you guys.

Is there anything that you want to change in your life? How and why are you going to do it?

I‚Äôve already put up a video about me, running away from my old life and moving to a new city to start over. 

And I just uploaded a video about how I quit smoking cigarettes. 

I plan on making videos about

- New and healthier eating habits and lifestyle 
- Start working out, and losing weight
- Staying sober and avoiding alcohol
- Dealing with my mental illness (BPD and OCD)
- Getting new hobbies and new friends
- Trying to get a job 
- Being creative, sewing, painting, DIY‚Äôs
- Getting back my spark for life 
- and so much more!! 

Here‚Äôs a link to my channel if you want to go on the journey with me.

qxq3y3,MentalHealthSupport,1637357562.0,"I need to vent before I lose my mind, I am so overwhelmed by life and peoples expectations I am almost ready to run. I don't know how to feel better and I feel guilty when I ask for help, then I get angry because no one seems to notice everything that I am doing and offer some help. Yes I am working on this, but every time I try to ask for help its like everyone forgets and just continues to take or I get put down for needing help in the first place depending on the person I ask. 

My dad had a stroke this past September, never wanting to take care of himself or visit a doctor brought him to this point. It wasn't so bad, he can still move but it did happen. We figured out he had diabetes and high blood pressure, things we could have gotten under control if only he listened. Let me add, he hasn't been the greatest dad I am his only child with my mom the product of an affair. He is married with 6 children in another country. He has always put them first.

 All of his children are grown but he was always expected to continue financial support. Its always been something that I argue with him about. He is 68 and retired, lives rent free with me and he continues to send money to them and can barely afford to take care of himself. Since he got sick and can't send as much as he did before they have completely forgotten about him. Now I am left with the burden of taking care of him emotionally and physically. I feel guilty for feeling resentment towards him and just mentally tired of it all. 

My mother, knowing all the things that I have piled up on me continues to make everything about herself. Its always I need, I need and I need. She has been up my ass about making her an appointment for her yearly mammogram and to get her eyes checked, she lives with my sister and she could very well do this for her but my mom makes excuses for her. I am expected to do everything because I stay home, she makes snarky comments about me not deserving what I have. I am just tired of her narcissistic ways. 

My husband, workaholic who never stops expects me to pull money out of my ass for all his projects that never get done and don't bring anything financially. He is the only one that works full time, I work from home. We live on a Farm because that is what we both wanted, he talked about a cattle business but he does not have the time for it. He is now building a large barn on his own, he is stressed out. I get it, his dream is to have a business that involves his passion for cows and horses. BUT again he does not have the time and not to mention these animals are sucking us dry and bring no profit. We are cramped in a three bedroom house with 4 teenage children, the plan was to expand the house either build a basement or finish an apartment building we have on the property (our oldest are 16). My dad lives in a small apartment away from our house, so we don't have to worry about him when it comes to living in the house. He changed that whole plan and now we are stuck with him building a barn for animals that only shit and eat. He will not be able to start building the extra bedrooms we need until he is done with this barn. By that time I worry that our savings will be in zeros and we will not have money to do what we really need to be comfortable in our home. I can't bring myself to tell him this because I do not want to be the one to destroy his dream. 

&#x200B;

But I am exhausted! By this time in my life, I was hoping my parents would have their shit together living on their own or something!!! That my husband would finally figure out that this dream of his will not happen unless he puts in the work that he does not have the time for unless he leaves his job which will leave us in debt and no house. That I am drowning alone, because he helps with nothing and only brings in the cash that he ends up spending in dumb shit then gets irritated because I can't save money. I am tired of being the only one trying to keep everyone else afloat while forgetting about my needs. Does anyone stop and think, who takes care of her???? Everyone just takes and takes. Takes my time, my money, my mental health everything!!!

moga2d,MentalHealthSupport,1618099900.0,"I'm not sure what to say except jus that. I don't just feel trapped in my own body, I feel like it's a fucking hostage situation. I already dealt with depression, anxiety, and ADHD and I had things under control. I got out of an abusive relationship, married my best friend, things should've been looking up. Them Covid happened and that was bad enough but suddenly I started dealing with seriously severe, unexplained fatigue. It used to be that I could clean the whole house, bathe the dogs, grocery shop, cook dinner, and shower all in one day and not break a sweat. Now I can barely stay on my feet for five minutes and I feel like I can't breathe, like I've just run a marathon. I can only manage to muster up the energy to shower MAYBE once a week. Shaving my legs? Ha. Cooking dinner? You mean putting in an order on Waitr? 

I went to the doctor, expecting it was anemia because I have a blood cell disease. Getting blood work is an ORDEAL. I have a really bad needle phobia. There was one point when I was sixteen and needed blood work my doctor gave me enough Valium to (in literally her words) ""knock a grown man over, we might need to wheel you out in a wheelchair."" Nope, I panicked and walked out, it's like it didn't even phase me. 

It has taken several years and a lot of therapy but we finally worked out a system because my doctor wanted me to get blood work done once a year. I take a milligram xanax the night before, and 4 milligrams the day of (for reference, even my worst panic attacks almost never need more than one milligram), so I can't drive myself. Lots and lots of water to make sure my veins are easy to find. Special numbing cream so I couldn't feel the needle. I have my own special tourniquet because the latex disposable ones are a trigger, both the sound and feel of them. My husband or (before I was married) my dad would come hold my hand. The nurse would take me to a room, let me lay down, I'd put on some happy music on my headphones. She'd come in with all the supplies on a tray covered with a paper towel to make sure I didn't accidentally see the needle. She'd draw from the back of my hand because the inside of my elbow was also a trigger. It's a whole fucking ordeal, okay? But this system worked and I've managed to get blood drawn three different times like this. 

Until now. The fatigue started and they did blood work no problem; everything looked good. My doctor gave me a referral for a cardiologist and a sleep study. Of course it took forever to get in to either and I had to do 4 different appointments with the cardiologist (one consultation, a stress test, an echocardiogram, then come in again for the results), each one being like a month apart because they were so booked. It took four months just to get me in for a sleep study, since they only have 4 beds a night. Both come back good, but I'm still dealing with this extreme fatigue so the doctor orders more blood work. 

Only now, my body won't give it up. I've gone three different times to try to get it done, and every time they either can't get a vein at all or the vein blows. They've had everyone at that office who knows how to do blood try and my husband is depleting his time off taking me to these appointments. 

I need to find out what the hell is wrong with me. I can't do anything I want to do. I miss cooking so fucking much; I used to cook every other night, my husband always had leftovers for lunch. I absolutely loved it, it was my favorite hobby. Now I'm lucky if I have the energy to toss something in the instant pot or oven. The house is a constant mess because four dogs and two cats shed A LOT. Not to mention we recently moved and half our stuff is in boxes or storage. I can get maybe one box unpacked by myself before I have to sit down. I'm sick of spending all my time in bed or on the couch. And the house is a cluttered half-unpacked mess and being stuck in this is not helping my mental health. I'm getting so depressed that I don't even enjoy the things I can do like writing, reading, catching up on shows, coloring. I just... exist. 

And my husband, bless him, he is trying so fucking hard. He works, handles dinner, does the dishes, does laundry, takes care of the pets, takes care of me. Half the time I wouldn't be able to get a shower without his help. I don't remember the last time I fixed my own plate of food. He's never once complained and just tells me this is what he signed up for when he said for better or for worse and I just need to focus on being here when he comes home each day, because there have been so many days when I've just wanted to end it. 

I hate my brain and my body right now. I've done everything I was supposed to. I've been to therapy, I'm on antidepressants. I got out of an abusive eight-year relationship and I thought once I finally got to the other side of that, I'd be okay. I thought that was the hardest thing I'd ever do. I got married to my best friend, I have an amazing support group of both blood and found family and they've been helping us move and unpack the best they can. Like I'm not alone in this. Life should be good, right? But no. No, now my stupid fucking body has to do this and my brain is kicking it into high gear with the depression and I'm tired, I'm just so fucking tired. I've spent a year not able to do the things I love, not knowing what's wrong with me, and my body won't even let me get the tests done I need to figure it out. And I'm still in therapy and doing the daily affirmations and like... yeah, when this started, I struggled with feeling useless and worthless because I couldn't do anything and I'm at a point where I know I am worthy even if I don't do anything, I'm loved, I'm not a burden, it's okay to take a rest and focus on me, all that. But I'm tired of feeling like this. I'm tired of not finding joy in anything, even the stuff I can do sitting in one spot. I'm tired of my entire life revolving around my bed and my couch or, if I do go out, needing to sit every few minutes and then spending three days afterwards exhausted and recovering. I don't want to kill myself, but I don't want to live like this. 

And I hate my body so much right now. It's like it's this neverending thing of trying to figure out what it needs and it not being enough. It's like my body is ACTIVELY fighting against me. And now my brain is in on it to. It's bad enough to not be able to get up and do things like cook and settle into our new house. But when I pick up a book and can't comprehend what I'm reading, or scroll through Netflix and can't even focus on one of my comfort shows I've seen a million times or get excited about a new show I've been wanting to watch, or even a movie, or anything... I need some kind of happiness to be able to keep going and I can't find it and I'm absolutely losing my mind.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthSupport/comments/moga2d/i_feel_like_im_in_a_hostage_situation_with_my_own/,I feel like I'm in a hostage situation with my own brain and body,,10,9,0.92

When I was a child I was forced to do homework by my father in a very aggressive and sometimes physical way. I was also forced to redo it often when he didn't my writing (letters were slightly outside of the lines for example). Over time, this manifested into a physical response whenever I engage my system 2 (slow) thinking. Meaning, whenever I really need to think a problem through, I get a physical, stress response in my groin. This has been very debilitating for me when it comes to work (even though I work in a fast paced, very demanding field) and I've overcome it with ADHD medication (does not happen when i take adderall) all of my adult life.

TW//

Yesterday, I (F, 20) finally had the courage to meet with a psychiatrist. That was the first time. Honestly, I was comfortable talking to her but she had made remarks that does not sound right to me. I told her about the instances where i was shown sexual advances that had scarred me until now and she said that maybe there were things i did for them to do those things to me. She mentioned this more than twice and... now... i have been questioning myself if maybe that was all on me. She also asked if i was the only one who's been victimized by these men and i said no. Then she said that i should not pin this on me too much cos i was not the only one. And i don't know. I just, it just doesn't feel right.

Do you think this is enough reason for me to find another psychiatrist? She responded okay with the other issues, i think. I've been thinking about it and i'm not sure if I want to see a new psychiatrist because i don't want to discuss everything all over again. 

May I know what your thoughts are? Thank you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthSupport/comments/kgroq2/seeking_help/,Seeking help,,10,5,0.92
kggaj3,MentalHealthSupport,1608411904.0,"In the past few months, there has been moments of ups, moments of downs; moments that made me pause, moments that have made me work hard. In all of those moments I have been forced to realize that with everything day, the best I can do is that in itself. 

What is this mindset that we have been conditioned to think we always have to be working? Why do we think this way? We must live in this present moment as if this is our only day, but as well as continue to have that mindset that our life is long, difficult, I know, I am right there with you.

Even when we do our best, what will come from that will usually be much different than our expectations. We can create goals, set intentions, but God and the Universe will always guide us to something better. It is all for our best self, all for our highest self. 

The life of being an entrepreneur definitely is bliss but with that, comes many struggles and different things that you have to make sure you make yourself accountable for. Accountability is the only way that we can continue to move forward, in this present moment. 

A few things that help me everyday to maintain presence is spending time in nature, meditation, journaling, painting, trying something new, playing video games and reading new context.

Today: Give yourself a hug. Tell Yourself you are **ENOUGH**. "" I Am Enough "". Sending you health and happiness on your journey today. 

I love you.

Now as a clinical counseling student, I have the resources to learn more about this. I just wanted to share some of the strategies that Ive learned about overcoming self-limiting beliefs.

1. Develop positive, healthy, and uncomfortable habits to be done as soon as the voice starts speaking. Use these habits to contribute to your goals! This teaches you to discredit that voice and constantly choose the right thing to do.
2. Start stating things you are grateful for. Gratitude literally forces the mind to think positively. It switches off a lot of stress hormonal centers.
3. Acknowledge the emotion behind the voice. Emotions are a sign! If you read the sign and move forward more effectively, the voice will have no feeling to use against you!

My father's mum and dad (my gan and grandad) have both passed away, but when my gran was alive she found it to painful for me to ask questions about him, learn about him. My mum suffers from mental health issues and I don't want to be prying over her memories with a subject that has obviously had a massive effect on her mental health. I know his name, his birthday and death day, I know he liked cars, played guitar, and was great at art. 

I feel like I am missing a part of myself. I wonder what kind of man I would be if I had his influence in my life. I have tried to connect to him through what he liked. I love playing guitar, doing design etc but why do I still feel sad about it. I never had a chance to learn from him, love him or hate him like other people have had with their dad's. Other men have come and gone, attempting to 'fill' the gap but when I was younger they never gave me any time, and I think they resented me for not being theirs.

Now I'm 23, my mum has a partner who is a really good guy, but since the age of 8 months to when I was like 17 there was just nothing that felt like a father to me. I feel hollow. I'm not sure how to process it and move on. Friends have said I need to talk to a therapist to try out all of this, and maybe this is a step towards that. It feels good to put it down, and maybe if other people have experienced similar issues they can give me some advice.

io6qtu,MentalHealthSupport,1599482535.0,"It was 13 or 14 March 2018. My father told me that I stole his money. I tried to prove that I never did it, but he continued to humiliate me. I went to my room. I felt like trash, sad and angry.  Later I went to kitchen where he was. My mother was there too. I told her what he told me. Then I took his arms. I wanted to put him outside 30 minutes, just to know how I feel. But my mother was thinking that I want to beat him. He tried to stop me, he fell on floor, and screamed: this thief want to kill me. I got so angry and sad that I lost control I kicked him and spat on him.

After that i was in bad mental state, that lasted 18 months. I had strong depression, guilt, self hate, pain in chest, i gained more than 20 kg in short time, I had suicidal thoughts non stop, tried suicide once, two time I was near it. 

Now I am not depressed or suicidal, but guilt and still stops me to be successful, to show people that I can make music and machines/electronics.

reason why I got so mad I because he was beating me since I was 4 and he stopped when i was 14, or 15. He was also beating my sister and my mother. Once he kicked my mother with wood in head, she was on floor 5-10 minutes. I was also bullied in school etc.


There is new problem: My mother went to doctor almost 2 month ago. She got results of laboratory tests and other papers. There were traces of blood on laboratory tests/results. I figured out that people that were doing those test, weren't caring too much about hygiene. My mother touched those papers and then furniture and food in fridge. Now I am afraid that there are viruses in refrigerator, like HIV and hepatitis and that I can get infected with it. So I always wash my hands before I eat and I was my hands after I eat and also wash my face, because there can be viruses and if I touch my eye, if I didn't was my hands I can get infected with HIV right? I also think that all furniture in house and computer are contaminated with hiv and I take a shover after I use computer. Only my bed is clean because I dont alow my mother to touch it. I also wash faucet and shampoo bottle before I take a shower, because my parents take food from refrigerator and then touch everything in house. And I wash my hands multiple times. I dont know how long those viruses can live in ice, but looks like hiv can live in ice/refrigerator forever. When I touch furniture or wall with my clothes I change my clothes. Sometimes when I take shower and accidently touch wall, I have to wash my hands again. Because of that I spend about one hour in bathroom, once I was 2 hours.

Also when I was working I had panic atacks when I had too many thing to do, and I would just block and I couldnt work.

EDIT: Maybe there are ways to get over the guilt and fear of contamination with hiv and hepatitis viruses from blood? And maybe there is a way to get rid of panic atacks. Maybe i shouldnt go to psychologist?

i7gunz,MentalHealthSupport,1597103915.0,"So, just to set this up for easy explaining, there are three of us in a throuple together: Lexi, myself, and the partner in topic, Karen.

K is 25, and idk what to say other than that i think she's losing her mind. L and I went on a vacation for a week and during that time we were gone everything kinda changed. Every day since we've been back its like non stop things that are wrong and have changed about her. We get back and she claims that she hit her head really hard while we were gone and ever since then she can remember everything that has happened since she was about 4 years old. She decided she was going to start a youtube career and has gone out and purchased multi thousands of dollars worth of equipment for it on credit cards. Then she came to us crying one day cause she realized she has adhd, too. (L also has adhd that she struggles with on occasion and is on adderall for.) In the next couple days it was that she's OCD. Now, shes saying shes starting to go deaf, but then always complains that everything is too loud, and that she is colorblind/blind, but everything is too bright for her. She has this green pair of sunglasses she almost always wears because the tint ""helps her see better"" but at the same time she's broken down and cried because ""everything being green is overwhelming""

She backs all of this behind ""not letting anxiety rule her life anymore"" but says she's always anxious. She says stuff like shes ""only going to do stuff she wants now and not do stuff because her anxiety""... but she went to the store and didn't put groceries away for three days due to ""not wanting to due it because her anxiety is telling her to"" so needless to say everything that was perishable had spoiled by the time we had gotten to it. It is really hard because some of the stuff she says she has the right concept but she's doing it all wrong in application and I just dont know how to make her see it. 

To L and I, this just seems like a giant beg for attention, but every time we try to give advice or try to help her in a way that doesn't follow her narrative we just get shutdown by her telling us ""that's just your anxiety speaking"" or ""you're being destructive and triggering my anxiety."" She's been caught up in lies with us in the past and anytime anyone suggests she's a liar she gets really upset.

K is in therapy, but she avoids the real problems and lies to the therapist. K's always misinterpreting whatever he says so that it fits into her own narrative and then holds it over L and I who also have our own depression and mental issues and acts very holier than thou as if she doesn't have the same issues.

TL;DR
Can you give us any r/advice? We really want to help her get on the right path, but we are completely lost on what to do. She's always been kinda controlling, attention needy, and kinda hyperbolic, but ever since she hit her head things have gotten 10x worse and it's become toxic.

hs3wgu,MentalHealthSupport,1594877167.0,"This is my experience, and I share it in the hope that it may help someone else feel less alone:

I have an Anxious/Preoccupied attachment style. What that means is that I have a *tendency* to be needy and insecure in my relationships, be them romantic or platonic. As a child, my relationship with my parents gave me a very uneven understanding of love and trust. I only began to learn about this in my late 20s (now early 30s), so by the time I began to address it, a lot of emotional damage had been done. 

None of us has likely had a very easy 2020. Everyone I have spoken to personally or professionally (I am a counselor, myself) has expressed the same experiences - loneliness, isolation, anger, fear, despair. As someone with a longtime history of depression and anxiety, these are feelings I can relate all too well with.

While I have become more competent at identifying when my attachment style has been triggered and working to cut it off before it carries me away, tonight has been very hard. I have realized that every instance of being emotionally triggered in recent months, especially those that I have successfully sorted before turning into a 'thing' has left a mark of sorts. Everyone of them has increased the emotional pressure and then... I learned to live with the pressure. It didn't decrease, I just got better at handling it. 

In the last few days I have been more and more easily triggered. It seems like everything calls to mind my loneliness (I am single), which makes me angry, which cycles back to loneliness, and so forth. Further, all but one friend in my life is married, and that one who isn't is coupled up. 4 times out fo 5, when I reach out to them, whether just to shoot the breeze or because I am having a hard time, my calls/texts go unresponded to or else long, long delays in a response. I understand why, and I do not fault them for having lives of their own, but it still makes things very hard. To whom does one reach out when there is no one to reach back out? That is where I am tonight, feeling needy - I very much *need* to speak to a friend just to be reminded that I am not completely alone - but it has reached the point that whenever I begin to reach out I convince myself of one of two things, either: 1.) they won't respond so why risk that feeling of rejection?; and/or 2.) you've bothered them enough with your neediness. Suck it up or they will leave you.

Live is uniquely difficult right now. It probably won't always be this way, but right now it is. Life is suffering with occasional glimpses of pure joy. If anyone reading this can relate to any of it, just know that you are not alone. It will not be like this forever, but in order for it to change you have to get up and do something about it. Talk to a counselor, apply for that new job, ask that person out, take that risk. If you fail, it will suck but you can learn from it.

Now I feel like I couldn't care less for anything at all. I don't know if this is something I should ask help for, but I can't help but feel there's always something bugging me. One time I felt so overwhelmed, I broke down at school. But I don't really know why I cried so much at the time. My friend circle just watched me there as I broke down, but I felt like they wouldn't understand. Whenever I try to listen and learn at class, I tend to lose focus and forget e.g. forget how to use a formula the teacher taught just a moment ago, or missed a number or so in the equation. I wanted to hone my technical ability in drawing but even then, I lost my interest in it. I'm not satisfied with anything I draw and I feel so empty inside. I see all these other people improving day by day but I feel like I'm always stuck. There's all these things giving me fleeting joy, like watching a show or reading some manga, but I revert to lay down into nothingness. My friends work really hard to make something for themselves one day but I feel like I'm just there, waiting for something even though there's probably nothing.

 The thing is, I don't feel any suicidal thoughts. I feel like killing myself is a big waste of time, and I don't wanna bother anyone or waste their time as well. I don't want to self-diagnose or anything, but my friends keep saying that I have a low self-esteem. That why don't I show all these amazing skills that I used to treasure anymore, it's just that, I don't really know anymore. I had a physical illness that led me to take antibiotics for more ten months (usually lasts around 6 months), but I don't really know if that's the cause. I can't talk to my parents because I feel like I'm not close to them enough and that they wouldn't understand since I kept on crying one time and they asked why was I being so emotional, stop crying.

I don't know anymore, all these decisions made me so overwhelmed, I can't decide anything for myself anymore. I don't know if anyone is even gonna see this anyway but maybe some random person on the Internet might've felt this way somehow. I don't know anything about mental health, but I've been feeling this way for the last two years.

fzcxyn,MentalHealthSupport,1586629448.0,"I find myself being overcome by rage at the smallest things. I spilled some pasta sauce the other day and threw my fork across the room. My drawing went wrong and I scribbled all over it and put it in the bin. My headphones unplugged themselves,I threw them down the stairs. I scare myself. It happens nearly every day. 

Certain things trigger me. Sounds like people chewing loudly or tapping things. Something small and insignificant can make me so angry. 

My brother makes me angry. Very angry.  Sometimes even to the point where I lose control and lash out at him with anything I can reach. I‚Äôve even threatened his life (in moments of anger never being serious). I‚Äôm scared for him. I don‚Äôt want to hurt him but I can‚Äôt help it sometimes. I lose control. I got so angry at him the other day I hit him and stabbed at him with a pen. I got really angry again today and almost the same thing happened but after I started scratching at my wrists. It was like an urge. I didn‚Äôt want to but I couldn‚Äôt stop. It‚Äôs gone red and a little swollen. I think it‚Äôs ok though. It made me feel calm again and that scared me even more. 

I have thought about suicide before but I could never do it. I can‚Äôt face the thought of leaving people behind. I don‚Äôt want to die but I don‚Äôt care if I do. I feel like I deserve to sometimes. 

It‚Äôs not just anger though. I often feel paranoid and have real trouble trusting people. I can‚Äôt hold a conversation at all even with people I‚Äôm close to. My mood changes in seconds. My mind wanders and I never get anything done. I do things that are almost nervous tics like biting the inside of my mouth, picking at my skin and pulling out my own hair. I can‚Äôt make decisions. At all. Even small ones. I‚Äôm too scared to tell anyone because I‚Äôm fucking insane. I know I am. I get flashes of killing or injuring people. I‚Äôm insane. I panic about small things but don‚Äôt care about big things. A whole day can be ruined by one thing. I talk to myself. I commentate to myself. I argue with myself all in my head. I‚Äôm crazy. 

I don‚Äôt want people to find out about this awful side to myself. They would hate me. I don‚Äôt want people to hate me just the thought of it scares me more. 

 I haven‚Äôt had the best childhood (my parents always argued and then split up). I don‚Äôt think that full explains it though. Why am I so messed up?

I have attempted suicide twice the last being in September of 2019 but there hasn't been a day since where I haven't thought about doing it again. My parents know how bad it is and even before the whole lockdown I was out of school and not leaving the house more then twice a week but I can't seem to get through to them how hopeless I feel.

 I realised the other day that I will probably never feel safe because I am always around myself and I just can't trust myself alone anymore. I desperately need and want help but I can't get any, I've had three therapists over the past two years one of them with CAMHS (child and adolescents mental health services) which was basically useless.

Last week two policemen came to my house due to a message I sent to childline but my dad just told them it was my way of expressing my feelings but it wasn't! I was telling the truth when I said I wanted to die because I do but my dad just doesn't seem to believe me, he only believed I was even remotely depressed after seeing me in the hospital after my first attempt. I truly feel like I'm a constant danger to myself and need to go somewhere to get better but I can't get anyone else to see how I feel. I don't have anyone to talk to and am just constantly getting worse. If anyone has any advice it would be very appreciated, thanks <3


Edit: thank you for all the answers and support they are all helpful and I really appreciate it

So. Last night one of my highschool friends tried to kill herself by ODing on pills. Me and her both have tumblrs (remnants of 2014) that we occasionally use for art and photography blogs. She posted what was more or less a suicide note to me, as I‚Äôm the only person who follows her on there. I wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúsupposed‚Äù to see it for another few days, as I was up way past one, and I‚Äôm usually out by 11 but for whatever reason I couldn‚Äôt sleep and decided to check tumblr on a whim and saw the post. 
Of course I called her. She tried to act like everything was fine and she didn‚Äôt know what I was talking about. A 15 minute phone call ensues. She breaks down, I tell her I‚Äôm driving to be house. She tells me I don‚Äôt have to, she‚Äôs going to get her mom and go to the hospital. I drove anyway just to be sure. 
They pumped her stomach in time. They admitted her to the ward. She‚Äôs okay. 
My problem is this. I live in a small town. people are already talking about how I ‚Äúsaved her life‚Äù and it makes me really uncomfortable. I just did what any normal human being should have.

e2ewnf,MentalHealthSupport,1574854784.0,"(Repost from r/vent)
 For context ,I am 15, living in Romania (remember this detail it plays a big part in this story).
 After the living hell that were the past two years. When I started high school, it felt like I finally got my shit together, I had a lot of friends,my grades were amazing(even more impressing to myself since I only got 6 and 7 (I think the American equivalent to that is like C or something)), I was in my first real life relationship (even though I regret it now) and it was honestly going amazing. I am FTM and stuff was better for me, I had actually started loving myself in a way, but that didn't last for two long, since I had to reverse all the progress I made with my transition. I grew out my hair again, started doing my makeup again and to my disgust, started to dress girly. And this was all from peer pressure and my mom. I love my mom, knowing I am trans would break her heart. She saw I started to dress more like a man ever since I found out I was trans, and she really pressured me to dress more girly and stuff. I really really care about her, she's had enough of my shit in the past few years and I don't think I could do this to her. As for peer pressure. Don't get me wrong I am not the type to do stuff to pleasure others, but , I do live in Romania. People here, gen Z kids more or less, are not really open to the idea of being trans. Most teens here these days have nothing against you if you're gay,bi,ace or whatever, actually I'm out on that part to literally everyone I know, and they're really chill about it. 
 And now to the main action. My now ex-girlfriend and I, had this group of friends with another trans dude from my school ( that is now her boyfriend, yeah nice I know, they got together as soon as she broke up with me). And because of them,I made a lot of friends with their friends, which some of happened to be in the same situation as me. They knew I was trans. My girlfriend back then and our friend knew too. But they weren't my only group of friends so for that reason I couldn't be the real me around the others, only with them. And they saw that as fakeness for some reason. 
Then 
They both began being assholes. So after a while of putting up with their shit I called em out on it. And them,and aaaaalllll of their friends that aren't even my friends anymore, just kind of started pointing out stuff about me, and basically just mentally tormenting me on a daily basis. 
I said I didn't want to argue but they continued. So people hated me when I tried my best to be the best of friends, so I became and absolute asshole for them to actually have a reason to hate me.
Also for context,I am not the best looking person ever(see pfp if ya want),so my confidence is very low,no matter how I dress.
So ever since I stopped talking to them(one or two weeks ago) the girly stuff started to happen,because I started to stay with only the other friends. And they (ex and co)started gatekeeping the entire trans thing even though I explained the whole situation to them. Now I don't even know who I am anymore. I never fit in with the girls, I started not fitting in with the guys anymore, I don't even fit in with the trans. What the fuck am I supposed to do,I am alone, and losing all of my remaining friends constantly. The amount of hate I get really just makes me think I am never good enough for anything, not even for living.
 On another note,I realised something from this whole thing. I have this one friend. We don't talk a lot but we get along pretty well. He's my literature buddy. He told me he doesn't message people unless they message him first,or even initiate human contact in any way. Because he'd rather read than get stuck in this weird vicious circle of a social life. And now I really feel what he was saying. I was extremely stubborn to want to have an ample social life, when my mental health is certainly decreasing as days go by.
I am afraid I'll become an outcast if I transition now,because that's what happened to all the trans people here I know. Wether I do it or not now, I think I'll become one either way.
I am sorry for wasteing your time with the chaotic hellhole of a post if you actually read it all, I just had to get this whole thing off my mind.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthSupport/comments/e2ewnf/my_social_life_did_an_oopsie/,My social life did an oopsie,,12,4,1.0

d1a44z,MentalHealthSupport,1567944485.0,"Random title aside, I'm now 6 months pregnant and can feel the baby kicking regularly, so I'm starting to finally relax and believe this one will actually be born healthy.

I broke up with my partner (father of my toddler and this baby) a few days ago for yelling at me yet again. I told him this would happen if he yelled at me again. He has a short fuse and is often irrational.

Scroll down to TL;DR from here if you want to skip the boring background bit lol It'll be a slog otherwise.

We signed an agreement a while back, which both sets of our parents signed as witnesses, whereby I am the custodial parent and sole guardian and daily decision maker, by mutual agreement, because he does not cope well with parenting responsibilities. We don't live together,but he has pretty free access for visits. By mutual agreement he isn't to be left alone with our son due to his mental health issues, so we arrange for them to have time together at his Mum's so he can just leave if he gets overwhelmed.

So basically, he has a pretty sweet deal; all the fun, none of the responsibility.

Last week I typed up the rules for our son's care and gave a copy to his Mum (my parents also have a copy). She has him two days a week, my parents have him two nights a week, and I have him the rest of the time (albeit my parents are helping a lot more at the moment due to the pregnancy so I can rest as needed). The purpose of writing the rules down was to ensure consistency across the board since son is 19 months and needs routine.

The rules are reasonable; when he should and shouldn't nap, what he's allowed to eat and drink, what safeguards are needed during naps and out walking, etc... Nothing overbearing, and both sets of parents agree with them and are happy to follow them.

Well, my ex lost his shit over one particular rule (two adults present if he's playing out front, due to inadequate fencing at both houses plus MIL is prone to falls) and instead of discussing it with me, he chose to yell at me, followed by threatening to take me to court for custody and accusing me of breaking the agreement by making rules without his say so (these rules have been negotiated with both sets of parents over the past year).

He also demanded that I follow that particular rule too because ""I'm his Dad and I say so!!!"" despite the fact that my front fence is high and secure. That's the only rule I don't follow myself because my fencing is fine (my parents don't have a front fence and MIL has a low and unstable fence)

So instead of getting into my usual depressive and suicidal cycle and feeling worthless, etc, I broke up with him and stood my ground. I talked to his Mum about what was going on and reassured her that it would not affect her relationship with our son, and I told him to take me to court if he wanted but not to use that as a threat to try and intimidate me.

----- TL;DR skip part from here...

I've battled depression and suicidality since I was 8, along with crippling self-doubt and insecurity.

Standing up to him like this and saying enough is enough without being dramatic or hysterical is HUGE!!! We're amicable, I made it clear that I intend to continue supporting him with his mental health and I would continue to nurture his relationship with our son, but I said ""no more"" to abusive outbursts.

I (21M) have had issues with my mental health as far back as I can remember. My OCD surfaced very early on (age 3), and my first big depressive episode happened at age 11. At 14, insecure and self-conscious as I was, I tried to kill myself by starving myself to death (I specifically remember wanting to waste away until my heart simply stopped). I nearly succeeded, but with the help of my best friend at the time, I got help and began taking medication. My body image has been distorted ever since, and I can‚Äôt tell what I look like when I see myself in the mirror. I don‚Äôt know if that makes sense, but that‚Äôs the best I can do in describing it.

I have PTSD from certain traumatic events that took place in high school, so depersonalization and derealization are familiar to me. I see a therapist on the reg (an amazing guy), and I‚Äôm still on medication. Both of these things have helped. However...I don‚Äôt know. I cycle through feeling positive about myself anywhere from half an hour to a couple of weeks, and then I‚Äôm back here: hating myself, wanting to cry, thinking about how big a relief it would be to just die.

One day, I‚Äôm proud of how far I‚Äôve come. The next, I‚Äôm disappointed in all I can‚Äôt seem to do. I want to write, but given five hours to do so, what do I have to show? Less than half a page.  My passion for reading has been much the same as my writing. I love college, but I soon won‚Äôt be able to afford it without finding another job, and I just don‚Äôt know how well I‚Äôll be able to handle both at the same time (I‚Äôm autistic and I have a very low tolerance for dealing with multiple sources of stress simultaneously. I just...shut down). I love working out, but the antidepressants that keep me functioning have also made me gain weight, and so I feel awful about myself. My past ED thoughts rear their ugly little heads. It‚Äôs hard for me to even leave my house...or my bed, somedays (like today). I feel like a useless waste of space.

I have good things in my life. I‚Äôve been with the same man for almost four years, and I love him dearly. I want to marry this man and build a life together. My sister is my best friend, and I‚Äôm close with my parents. I have a cute dog who loves and depends on me. I enjoy school. I can‚Äôt leave these things behind. It‚Äôs just not an option, no matter how often I wish it could be.

I‚Äôm stuck in a loop of thinking I might be okay, then silently craving death the moment I feel like I‚Äôm not.

Sorry to unload here. I‚Äôm just exhausted today. Some days, I just feel like my brain is irreparably broken. I guess I‚Äôll wait and see if tomorrow is any different.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthSupport/comments/cmy7p6/bad_brain_day/,Bad brain day.,,11,9,1.0

I was getting drunk with a few friends and one of them was so drunk that he needed to sleep on my couch, which was fine. After a while, he tried convincing me to have sex with him. I was conflicted because I liked him but it didn't feel right, I was nearly falling asleep and couldn't even push him off of me. He was biting me and pulling off my shorts and I couldn't even get any fucking words out. He was talking dirty to me while I was trying to figure out how to get it to stop. I'm glad he actually did get off of me after getting the message that I didn't want to do anything. He scared me so much.

Her medication was put up high and you‚Äôd need a chair to get to it. Afterwards she runs outside barefoot 3 miles to the end of the road (we live on a dirt road). I chase her down and bring her back to the house. She then runs to the kitchen and grabs two knives. One pointed towards her neck and one pointed at my stomach. There was absolutely no reasoning with her anymore and I had to call 911 on my daughter. 30 minutes later four police officers arrive and they walk in on my daughter trying to attack me. I leave the kitchen and she tries to go after one of the officers. They came close to tasing my daughter. One of them distracted her and then another one handcuffed her and pinned her to the ground. She kicks and screams while they carry her to the back of the police car. They take her to the hospital and I meet them there...

She‚Äôs been in the hospital multiple times for suicidal thoughts, running away and the previous time she wrapped a cord around her neck at school.

&#x200B;

Not really sure what I'm hoping to achieve from this but can't hurt to get it off my chest.

&#x200B;

So I've been on antidepressants (Escitalopram) for the last year or so and currently I am being tested for bipolar, however I don't feel like it's getting me anywhere.

&#x200B;

Lately I've been struggling big time, just feel suffocated lately. 23(M) still living at home but I feel like I have done nothing in my life to this point.

&#x200B;

I was in college but dropped out after a year and have been working fulltime since then. The plan was always to go back to college. But I just can't figure out what I want to do with myself. I feel lost. No motivation to do anything, don't really feel any enjoyment from anything. My life currently consists of going to my work and coming home and watching the same YouTube videos. 

&#x200B;

I just feel jaded and I'm tired off feeling like this, I don't know I guess does anyone know of any support groups or anything online I just feel completely alone even though I have a good support group, I just feel like I am burdening them with my problems.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthSupport/comments/c1ni5u/tired_of_being_tired/,Tired of Being Tired,,11,0,1.0

I will not go into length about how we got here. Years of mental health concerns, issues with family, friends, relationships and work have lead us here. If you are curious I can answer questions privately.

On Monday, I was on a plane for a work trip for 6 hours, when I landed a I received a call from her best friend. She was in an ambulance on her way to the hospital. I dropped everything, ran off the plane, got in a cab and rushed to the hospital.

She ingested approximately 13,000mg of Bupropion (Welbutrin), which is substantially more than what is required to be fatal.

At first, she seemed okay. Tired, groggy, but she was awake and speaking to me and the paramedics. We called her family, she was able to speak with them briefly while we were waiting for doctors to attend to her.

This sleepiness and grogginess continued for several hours. These moments felt sad, but manageable. She was scared, sad and sick but she was okay.

About 4 hours later, the hallucinations and seizing began. Her eyes were permanently rolled back into her head, she couldn‚Äôt vocalize words but was attempting to speak. She was mumbling, panicking, screaming. She was terrified and didn‚Äôt know where she was. She attempted to run away from the nurses and myself several times, she tore her IVs out multiple times. I had to hold her down and call for nurses. Eventually, she had to be fully restrained in her bed. From this point on, she alternated between a deep sleeping state, seizing, convulsing and panic attacks. Every 5 minutes or so she would wake up screaming, struggling violently to get out of her restraints. I would attempt to calm her, holding her hand, telling her she is safe and we are going to be okay. She didn‚Äôt know who I was. She was terrified of me, the doctors and the nurses. Anyone touching her was met with violent outbursts. Seeing her look up at me with fear in her eyes, convinced I was going to harm her is something I can‚Äôt get out of my head. This pattern continued for over 24 hours.

After her panic attacks, her eyes would roll back, and she would fall back onto the bed and see a drastic reduction in heart rate and breathing. During a few of these moments, I thought she had died and broke down. But she‚Äôs a fighter, she made it through each one of these moments and kept fighting.

Eventually, she became aware enough to speak, somewhat. If she slowed down, and tried really hard she could vocalize a few words at a time. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt take my organs‚Äù , ‚Äúdon‚Äôt cut me open‚Äù , ‚Äúyou aren‚Äôt (my name) .. what did you do with him?‚Äù. The hallucinations continued for another 12 hours, with her slowly becoming more able to speak, and being able to listen. After hours of talking her through the situation, she started to be convinced, I could see she was starting to believe it was me. I got her back. Slowly over the next few hours I was able to tell her the story, what happened to her, where we are, how long we‚Äôve been here.

We are now 5 days after the incident, she was just medically cleared yesterday and is under psychiatric evaluation.

I have not slept, I can‚Äôt close my eyes without seeing her hurting and struggling. I couldn‚Äôt leave her alone in there for even a minute. Now that we have confirmed she is going to survive, I am coming to my own reality of what has happened, I am struggling with guilt, that I am feeling in need of support when she is the one who needs me more than ever.

I don‚Äôt know what to do‚Ä¶ I am being strong and supporting her through this, but I feel like I am close to my own breakdown.

11ka50j,MentalHealthSupport,1678128824.0,"So I (M 17) have been together with my boyfriend (M 17) for two months now

The first month was smooth sailing, but ever since school stress started again, he has been acting really strange

He is often times doing stuff in class, like destroying his psychology book or asking me questions out of context and then forgetting about having said everything (""May I have some ice cream?"", ""Give me the butter honey"" or ""What type of pottery do you like?"")

I've also watched him drink water and then promptly letting it slowly drop out of his mouth onto his books (unintentionally, since he was all worked up afterward)

What is even more strange is that every time he gets home (he doesn't live at home, he lives in assisted living since his mother is...difficult and his father left) he sends me these audios telling me that he can't handle all this anymore and that he is going to be burnt out soon if this keeps going, I calm him down and then he actd like nothing ever happened

He also sometimes sends me audios of him just screaming that he'll gonna go mad,followed by an audio that he's absolutely fine

I don't believe that, and I try to be there as much as I can, talk to him, etc.

Every day for a week or even more now

Moreover, on Wednesday last week, he had such a bad panic attack in school that he wouldn't even talk to me

After I hugged him, he said he was gonna ditch latin today and left to go to the nearby river to chill out a bit, I am always a bit worried because 2 years ago he overdosed on mexalen and almost died and the river is used frequently as a suicide spot

I let him go, an hour later he came back and told me he felt a lot better after having some peace and quiet

But then I felt like shit because I was overthinking (I attempted suicide twice too, but this isn't about me) suddenly, so I went to go to the toilet to cry, he went with me and got me back to class after wiping my tears

We had 11 hours of school that day

After drinking a good amount, I simply went to sleep, hoping I wouldn‚Äôt wake up. Obviously, I did. I felt awkward and ashamed about the whole situation and came clean to my guardian, who decided to bring me to UCLA for a 72 hour hold- if needed. 

In the main sector of the hospital, I waited hours to talk to somebody. I was told to strip down all of my clothes and changed into an uncomfortable hospital gown. There, I was given a COVID test, an EKG, had my heart rate, blood pressure, etc monitored. I never received the results of the COVID or EKG tests while I was there. While there, I continued waiting hours in the hallway until I was transferred to the first room with a couple chairs, medical devices and a miniature bed. I slept there for a couple hours while my guardian waited with me. Then, I was taken to a room with another patient and a real bed. I stayed in this room for over 24 hours and was not allowed to leave. My guardian went to get food once but that was it. 

The hospital was unable to find a place for me to stay which was why it took so long and tried to convince my guardian multiple times to pay something like $5000 to get me transferred to another hospital hours away. My guardian refused. Finally, the hospital found me a room where I was taken. I wasn‚Äôt allowed to keep any of my belongings and no visitors were allowed, so I had to say goodbye to my guardian there. Here, things got way worse.

The section I was in was for teenagers but most people there were almost adults. The staff were for the most part unfriendly and didn‚Äôt treat the patients with respect. We were given no privacy and the staff were mean. When in the main/activity room, we were made to share personal things about ourselves and everyone had to share. It was uncomfortable. We were allowed to watch shows but only ones that were things for kindergartners. Blood pressure was taken every day and we were given medicine that we weren‚Äôt told about. The only good part about it was that we were allowed to draw in the main room. The other patients were horrible. They constantly talked about drugs and sex and would show off self harm scars and other triggering things and the staff paid no attention. One patient told me their explicit sex experiences that I never asked to hear and even told me in detail how to get drugs from the staff and get so high that I could piss myself. In the main room, there was a 17 year old, autistic male who would drool into his mask until the staff would change it. This male would often inappropriately touch me, such as putting his hands on my thighs and push them towards my crotch slowly and groping my shoulders inward towards my breasts. He would also make comments such as ‚ÄúWhen we get out, we should get married‚Äù or, ‚Äúdo you have a boyfriend? If not..‚Äù and things like that. I asked him to stop many times and he didn‚Äôt. Or, he would stop for a moment and then resume. It was disgusting. I asked the staff for help constantly, sometimes even on the verge of tears, and they always replied with ‚Äúit‚Äôs fine, he‚Äôs autistic‚Äù or, ‚Äúhe‚Äôs not hurting anyone,‚Äù or simply shrug it off. It was the cruelest torture. I simply sat while he touched me and waited for him to stop while trying not to cry. The staff didn‚Äôt care at all.

At night, other patients screamed loudly and banged against doors, while the staff held the doors to their rooms closed, making them unable to get out. The rooms were cold and had close to nothing in them. There was a small square window on the front door, a desk, and only a curtain to the bathroom, no door. When trying to sleep, staff would shine flashlights through the window or bang on them to ‚Äúcheck on us‚Äù. It was terrifying. When showering, a staff member would stand inside the room, behind a curtain and sometimes come in to see what I were doing. It was horrifically uncomfortable. Most of my memories from the bedrooms were remembered as me shivering on the cold floor, drawing pictures (and often crying). 

A therapist and psychiatrist would meet with me often and would ask extremely intrusive questions. They didn‚Äôt care about my situation in the slightest and didn‚Äôt even pretend to. When I asked them if I could go home soon, they paid me no attention and basically said ‚Äúit depends‚Äù. 

I ended up spending an entire 7 day week in that torture and was left extremely traumatized and feeling so much worse than when I actually got there. If I could go back and change the fact that I went there, I would. I will never be the same person I was before going there.

uakif0,MentalHealthSupport,1650766417.0,"I care about them, and I wont deny that before I get into my reason behind avoiding them. I also want to apologize in advance incase some of this makes no sense. I just need a place to spill it all out because I am an emotional wreck right now. I know It's frowned upon by some people that not wanting to have anything to do with your family is immoral, selfish, or ungrateful. I agree that some people who avoid their people are doing it to punish them, or because maybe they truly are ungrateful; but in my case, and many other cases, people avoid their families because it's bad for their well-being. I am very grateful for the family I have. They have provided me with a roof over my head, clothes on my back and food to eat. However, that alone is not enough for me to say ""skrew my mental health, I'll just suck it up and go insane in time."" I believe that if ANYONE; family or not--if they are causing you unhappiness, anxiety, depression, or just stress, you have a right to limit your interactions with them. I know myself more than anyone, and I know that if I force myself to be around them just because it's ""socially acceptable"" .. I cannot progress the way I deserve to mentally. I will continue to struggle with my anxiety and other mental health problems because I am constantly exposing myself to the very thing causing me most of it. I have looked at my family as a whole, and I know that they don't mean to be abusive with their ways because thats how they were brought up, but they are abusive. Some people may agree with this, maybe some people won't depending on how they were raised-- but in my opinion, belief and with my experience, the way they punished me growing up was awful and traumatic. I remember being beaten with belts, cords, and shoes, or anything they could find. I was told to stop crying when being beat. Told that I don't have a reason to cry about the pain that they were causing me because I made a mistake. I was emotionally abused with gaslighting. My interest as a child and even today is constantly being shamed. One thing that upsets me more is that I can't come out as lesbian because my dad is homophobic. He will kick me out and I just can't afford that. I have always felt like I wasn't allowed to express myself because of the fear that I will be made fun of by them, or called ""weird."" Basically, anything that they don't like or agree with personally, is considered ""strange"" or ""white."" Mind you, (and this is not saying ALL black households do the same thing) but  I am made fun of for the music I like, my style, the way I talk, everything about me gets picked apart because it simply doesn't fit in with the ""black crowd."" I feel like an outsider. I'm always supressing my true identity to avoid it. They tell me I was probably ""switched at birth"" because I'm just different from them even though clearly, I'm not. Genetics are to blame. I can't even sit down and talk to them and tell them how I feel about any of this. I have tried multiple times and I am always greeted with more gaslighting. They say I'm being stupid, sensitive, or they are offended by the way they brought me up. Apparently, I'm not allowed to feel any pain towards the way I have been treated for years. I have learned to supress my emotions and that's not healthy. It has been showing up with sh behaviors. I'm supposed to accept what they do to me or be punished because they can't hold themselves accountable. Over the years, I have grown as a person and they are still mentally in the same place. It's time for me to leave. I am old enough now to save money and move out. I plan on cutting contact and just being cordial with them. I won't completely abandon them but I won't be putting up with the bullshit anymore. I don't feel accepted here. I don't feel happy here. It's time for me to move on. For now, all I can do is distance myself as much as I can. I want to grow even more. I want to be better than them. I know if I ever adopt kids, I won't put my hands on them, I won't emotionally manipulate them, and I will allow them to express themselves. If I ever hurt them I will hold myself accountable and do better.

Hello, yesterday I broke up with my boyfriend who I also consider my bestfriend. My life is not going very well at the moment and I feel like this was kinda the last straw. He told me he has some problems with his mental health and feels like he needs some time to himself. He says that if he can not care for me (because of the state he is in) then there's no point in staying together. To give some context we started as fuck buddies right after he broke up with his ex and then got into a serious relationship but have never said ""I love you"" to each other. He told me that he is feeling insecure about our relationship because of this as well. I feel like I am not enough for him even though I am putting my heart into this relationship. I feel so insecure because he loved his ex so much... I often ask myself what do I not have that she does? I admit that I am not a very easy person to deal with since I come from a past of emotional trauma and abuse and feel unconforable doing various things like complimenting him and saying he looks cute and so on. This and some other behaviors bother him but are not the cause of the way he is feeling. I am feeling very overwhelmed by this whole situation given the fact that I do not have a job and my family is really struggling financially.

This was when I was around 16. At 17 COVID started and the world shut down. I‚Äôm going to be honest I was so relieved. I dreaded having to drive. I just couldn‚Äôt bear the thought of being in a car next to tiger cars at such speeds knowing how absent minded I can be. I always feel so foggy to some degree. I get distracted easily by my own thoughts. I just zone out at the worse times. You can imagine zoning out while driving is dangerous. I didn‚Äôt want to make mistakes in something that I‚Äôve always been reminded is extremely dangerous. I obviously lived in a part of the country with a lot of cargo to transport meaning a lot of large trucks. So that added to my fear. I avoid this shit till now. 
I recently got diagnosed with adhd and depression. My psychiatrist made it obvious my adhd is very prominent (she just diagnosed me with 10 mins of talking). I‚Äôve done my research on it after too. ITS SO OBVIOUS. 
Now I take meds for my depression (Zoloft) it‚Äôs helped my anxiety a bunch. So I have been able to start driving lessons. It‚Äôs great. I‚Äôm still very gone mentally and have almost ran reds, stop signs and into a couple cars. I‚Äôm getting there. My fears were all because of this disorder. Yet here I am. 
Getting treated like shit because I don‚Äôt Have a license. I put my safety first and everyone shits on me for it. I should of learned to drive in the summer and I should of just done it. Yet I didn‚Äôt fell safe and comfortable. They still yell at me now to drop the fear while in my lessons. 
Am I wrong? For not starting these lessons early knowing there was something wrong with me? I just wanted to wake up. That‚Äôs all. I‚Äôm almost there. I‚Äôll be out the fog one day. I feel like such a failure for this.

The first day he was found unconscious on the road and brought into ER. The next morning we went in for counseling. That evening he started becoming disoriented. He became a whole other person. I took him to the hospital because I was worried for his safety and he ran away. Once again after 6 hours I found him some nice Christian found him and was helping him get home. I had to call cops to cancel his missing persons. When they arrived they lied to him took him to hospital saying it‚Äôd be 4 hours but ended up Pink slipping him. He and I both requested to speak to each other and also requested that he not be put in small rooms because claustrophobia. They lied to us both saying he didn‚Äôt wanna talk to me and I didn‚Äôt wanna talk to him. They locked him in a room for 10 hours and after becoming mad they injected him with some random drug.

I put in 32 hours of unpaid clinical time each week at a hospital where I am getting my training to become a Rad Tech. The program I am in has been nothing but disappointing. My clinical instructor is a bully to me and treats me like I‚Äôm some idiot whose 16 years old and in high school.

Since i need closeness and physical touch in a relationship i am really not handling it well
We used to see eachother at least once a month.
Its been literal torture and the loneliness has been making me so angry and sad that i have been taking all of it out on him.. i feel bad..
Since i graduated high school last years and didnt get into any university i applied to last year i stayed on the island where i live and  i dont really have any friends here...
Ive tried going to therapy and the therapist didnt want to put me on meds since i was in lone and it would numb all my feelings.

My psychiatrist joined a big company a few years ago and her old practice is gone, files archived. 
Her new practice I thought had a good reputation(but realized its ratings are really low)
I tried to get into her practice with multiple phone calls and even mailed in an application/new patient packet and never heard back. 
Okay, whatever ill roll with it. 

So a couple years later since I am not her patient anymore and my primary and my mental health provider wanted records of proof of the medicationI‚Äôve been on. 

The number to her old office goes nowhere and I call her new practice to get ahold of her to see if I can get my files. 
I was hung up on by the receptionist and passed around to the medical records department multiple times when I kept explaining it was her OLD practice not theirs that I needed the records from. 
They said on the phone they sent her a message, weeks pass, nothing. 
I call again and am very adamant this time and the receptionist speaks with her and tells me ‚Äúyou cant get your record‚Äù I said ‚Äúwhat‚Äù she said ‚Äúits in archive‚Äù ‚Äúokay‚Äù ‚Äúyou‚Äôd have to pay‚Äù ‚Äúokay i am willing to pay‚Äù ‚Äúyou cant get it but we can send a letter of diagnoses‚Äù ‚Äúokay‚Äù she takes my name, number, address, email.

So this morning I decided I‚Äôd give her one last chance and let her know if I don‚Äôt hear back that I would file a complaint. The new receptionist took me very seriously and was even kind to me.

i can't tell CAMHS anything because then the social worker will tell my mum everything, and she's the issue. not completely but definitely a big part of my problems... but if I tell them she's the issue then she'll find out and when she does find out I'll get thrown out the house at the age of 15...

I'd have nowhere to go

I don't want her to find out but I have to tell somebody about this...

My Sister the legend

Many people survive cancer or MS, or a terminal severe traumatic brain injury, something physical and life changing. Everyone rallies around. Schizophrenia in a healthy young teen demonstrates people avoid, rather than support you

My beautiful, gifted and intelligent sister has survived with a scary trauma induced psychiatric episode age 19 after high school (no drugs no alcohol, it was child traumatic psychiatric PTSD) where she got psychosis and schizophrenia as a previously healthy normal young woman, she was a straight A student, no troubles ever. We are like twins, a year apart

This is my purple star to my beautiful sister who never ever gets credit for her pushing on without much support, was bullied badly in high school and at home, despite her illness. She has never ever received admiration or support from anyone but me not even family to say ‚Äúyou‚Äôre a survivor‚Äù but I am so damn proud of her; she turns up with a smile every day to see me no matter what, who never gets credit for her survival story when others who get credit for their brain tumours out or chemo have more support than she does, she does it quietly and pretty much solo (socially) not many understand. Even if she had a few hundred strangers online write nice words it would bring a tear to her eye that at least some people might care in this world

My sister is so amazing; she shows me love I never thought possible. She has all her troubles but never fails to support me, I have spine damage and pain and she is always there for me and she makes me laugh, she never lets me down ever. And even though I wish she was married with kids I appreciate that without that is less pressure on her right now

I wish a guy could see all that I see and not what she lacks. I wish we could all see the potential I see in others even with psychosis or mental illness; she is literally so damn intelligent and a beautiful soul; we joke she is the savant from Rain Man, she has so much to offer to world. On medication she is stable but unfortunately It‚Äôs challenging for her to finish work or study, she could do vet science but has not been able to finish. She used to be top of her class in high school but I try to get her to focus on her achievements that aren‚Äôt the same as her. Peers. I say she has a PhD in traumatic brain levels and psychological stress.

I wish we could support those with mental health issues more so they are seen more as a person or someone with potential, and not someone less of a person or less worthy like society makes them feel. They need more support than a cancer patient who has their mind still (both our parents survived lymphoma and a brain tumour and that was less intense.)

For anyone reading this with family or who has a mental illness; you are loved and appreciated for your struggles. My sister is worth more than her weight in diamonds and gold for surviving in this cruel world with psychosis, where men make fun of her for being different and I am the one that defends her until the death. She deserves a fucking war medal it‚Äôs been that intense, traumatic and lonely/scary for her

When I was 14 I was the stereotypical little scene girl on MySpace. I was obsessed with emo bands etc. in my small suburb we had a lot of local bands that played at churches. There was one band in particular that was really really big for our town and actually played warped tour... anyways. All the guys of this band were Known the be extremely Christian. They were youth leaders at the church, their band was like Christian screamo type deal. I was obsessed, as were all the other high schoolers in that whole scene. The guys of this particular band were older- like around 7/8 years older. I remember going to shows and every time they‚Äôd go on I‚Äôd sing along and just stare at the lead singer like I was just head over heels... you know, teen girl crap... and he‚Äôd always stare back and give a smile or wink. After maybe two shows we became MySpace friends. One day, a couple months later I get a message from him and he‚Äôs telling me he had a dream about me and when I‚Äôm 18 he wants to marry me bla bla. At this point I had just turned 15 and I was in shock and over the moon, at first I didn‚Äôt even believe it.

Well, to make this way way shorter- you can guess how things went. We ended up dating. I was 15, he was 23. He had me wrapped around his finger and also had the entire Christian thing there to help with any manipulation. I was convinced it was love. The greatest love story ever. He lied to me so many times to get what he wanted, said he was a virgin so he could take mine, even pretended to cry when it happened. Eventually things escalated and he started grooming me. Bribing me with shopping mall trips as long as we‚Äôd also buy lingerie that he could take hundreds of photos of me in. The photos that he would eventually post in all kinds of sex groups online. And send to other girls my age in my town. Things escalated, but the time I was 16 he had gotten me pregnant twice and told me I‚Äôd get abortions if I didn‚Äôt want him to go to jail. So I did. Once the photos got boring he took it farther- getting me drunk and taking videos to send, etc. As all of this is happening he‚Äôs keeping up his innocent Christian facade... but not necessarily hiding our relationship, I am the talk of our small town. His band all quits but won‚Äôt tell him off- no one including my parents ever went to the police.

Once I hit 17 is when things got really weird. I went to warped tour and had met another older guy who was a merch guy- My boyfriend made arrangements for him to take me to a hotel and do what he wanted with me and I was to go home and tell him all about it. There were a few times that happened with different people, and if I came home crying or upset he would scream at me that I was ‚Äúruining it‚Äù for him. At this point I had dropped out of school and moved out of my home to live in a bedroom with him that he rented (he‚Äôs 25 at this point). We drank, he took pictures, drank, took videos, drank. For quite a while that‚Äôs what it was but eventually it got boring for him because I started to refuse. That‚Äôs when I realized he was talking to other younger girls, getting nudes from them etc. I became increasingly depressed and eventually he kicked me out... I wasn‚Äôt useful anymore.

Now since then it‚Äôs been YEARS. I am 29 now. I‚Äôve been in and out of psych wards from severe anxiety and depression. Every time a therapist would tell me to reach out to him and ‚Äútell him how I feel‚Äù he would gaslight me and tell me I was crazy and we were in love and he wasn‚Äôt a predator. My anxiety turned into panic disorder. I drank myself into oblivion.

BUT NOW. I am 29. I have been with my fianc√© for 10 years in December. We have two children. And I love my little family. I see a therapist. I‚Äôm on medication to help manage panic attacks.... BUT, I have dreams. Weekly, of him. I have urges to message him. I have invasive thoughts. Most days are okay but these invasive thoughts and dreams are sometimes too much to handle. Sometimes I just wish to be validated by HIM which I know will never happen. Everyone around me knows the story and I feel like it‚Äôs just old news. I don‚Äôt feel like I can genuinely talk to anyone about it and I also don‚Äôt even know what I‚Äôd say.

he13dv,MentalHealthSupport,1592860841.0,"Ight venting time

Have a feeling nobody would read this but I don‚Äôt give a fuck. Also I prefer just to do these posts instead of dming a friend or something cause I feel like I annoy them that way and dming a stranger to talk to makes me feel a little bothered.

I‚Äôm being forced to stay in a car for 10 hours and I have a fear of being in cars. It‚Äôs gonna hail again when I‚Äôm in there so that makes it worse.

I feel ignored and unwanted in all of my discord servers. Even when I try and vent they just don‚Äôt try to help me but when anyone else vents, or posts a drawing, or something they get praised and loved and supported or get mental support or something. People rarely respond to me now

I feel like I‚Äôm always just used to vent to and have nobody to vent to so I had to make a note thing for it instead.

I hate everything I create. Any drawing I make, I hate it. Clay thingy, hate it. A friendship with someone, I feel like I‚Äôm just going to disappoint them. 

I‚Äôve been crying a lot more and just don‚Äôt want to deal with anything or anyone. Since I‚Äôm at a farm with about 19 other people there‚Äôs nowhere private for me to cry so I feel embarrassed when I do. 

My sister constantly keeps telling me she hates me and I‚Äôm already told that enough

I‚Äôm probably gonna have to redo the school year since I failed too many classes. I don‚Äôt want summer to end because I don‚Äôt want to go back to my school where it feels like everyone either hates me or thinks I‚Äôm too sensitive to be mean to in any way. 

It feels like I‚Äôve been a mix of eating too much and not eating enough. Half the time I wake up extremely nauseous and need to take some Tylenol to help with it and when I try eating I feel like I‚Äôm eating too much and need to stop.

I want to post drawings I‚Äôm actually proud of here but I feel like nobody would want to see them or like them. Most of the drawings I make have gore and characters people don‚Äôt know so I don‚Äôt know what the point is.

I showed a certain discord my rabbit foot since it helps me calm down when I‚Äôm stressed and they kept saying they‚Äôd cry if it was real. Because of the store I went to to buy it, it‚Äôs real but since I didn‚Äôt want them to cry I had to tell them it‚Äôs a faux foot. This just pisses me off and makes me feel worse because one of the only things that keeps me calm is gonna cause someone else to cry and rabbits are common as fuck (better then buying the bobcat, lynx, or coyote tail). Yea, I feel kinda bad for the rabbit but it could‚Äôve already been dead when they found it. It just feels like they‚Äôre overreacting about something that keeps me calmed down and now I wanna cry since it feels like they are upset with me.

I have asked her time and time again to please not vent to be about her relationship problems to me (I understand that she needs to speak to someone, but her daughter should not be the first person that she goes to; maybe a close friend?).  Every time she has some sort of problem, she will come to me and start talking despite me asking her not to, and then throw a hissy fit when I don't back down.  She will either continue talking and ignore me, telling me to ""tune it out"" or, she will stop, make me feel bad about it, then begin to mumble about how I am a disappointment and how she has no one, making sure that I hear the parts that I specifically would not want to hear.

I'm sorry i just need to talk, and I got nobody to listen.

About 5 weeks ago I found out i was pregnant, I was dating a guy from tinder since new year. but it was weird. he was weird. I felt he didnt like me,I felt he was manipulating me. I even called it. I said to him ""I think you are a very good manipulator if you want to be"".

He said yes.

But we had a good time, he kept comming back but as time went on it became more and more clear he just came to fuck and leave., And thats fucking fine if you tell me thats what you after. Dont play me. Dont use my feelings.. please

I told him about my last relationship 6 months earlier, in which i got dumped without ""notification"" after i found out i was pregnant (the guy just disappeared) and a few days later i had a miscarage.

he knew all my (fresh) pain

Anyway 3 months in I found out i was pregnant (again). I tell him. he says ""its not mine, and im going to block you"".

Like, wtf .. why? he tells me he got back with his ex girlfriend who he has a baby with.

So I tell him, dont treat me like this, talk to me like normal person and if you going to ignore me I will tell your ex everything.

So he disappears and I find his ""ex"" girlfriend, and I send her a message.

""Hi, I'm sorry to tell you, but I am pregnant of your boyfriend

GUESSE WHAT SHE SAYS?!

She says: congratiolations! how are you feeling?""

So I dont really know what to say and after a few minutes of her beeing queit I ask her, ""how long have you been back together?""

They've never broken up,

Every single word that he told me was a lie. he was living with her and their baby all this time.

So by now dickhead is calling me in a panick (now he can talk) for me to stop talking to his girlfriend. and I am in schock. I've been played all this time. I've been used all this time. and now I'm fucking pregnant. I live on social secutiry, I smoke weed and tabacco all day long. I am alone, I am a aimless lowlife.

So end of the story. He never spoke a word to me again.

i got the abortion. and I feel so fucking shit about it.

I wanted it. Everybody around me is having babies (im at that age) and I see the pictures all day while sitting alone at home.Beeing ignored. Dumped, Used. having a pointless life.

I even asked him (drunk and lonely) ""come put a baby in my belly"" (not knowing he had a girlfriend obviously) and he came.

I tried talking to friends. but one told me I was selfish for even thinking about keeping it, because what do I even have to offer? (her words) and the other one told me I'm just looking for attention. so now I dont have 2 friends anymore. Everywhere quarantine, and I am going to shit here, by myself at home.

I feel like im going to regret this all so much later.

Like not a little I feel like this is going to tear me appart.

Later when I'm alone and still nobody wants to make a family with me, I'm going to hate myself for not having the strenght to do it by myself. I am a weak person. my friends where right, I got nothing to offer a baby. (still dont have to tell me like that, isnt that just rude??)

Everything, the pregnancy, finding out I was played, used, was so much. and the few people I could talk to where very clear in their advice.

I was very focussed on what to do about the pregnancy, but now that thats done and dead. all the emotions come at once. the rejection, the manipulation, the doubting myself and beeing agry I wanted to be polite and dont ask weird questionds like ""are you flat out lying to my face right now or is it just me?"".

I am so agry I trusted him. I am so angry he pretends I dont exist. soo angry and I cant do shit about it. i cant do anything anymore. its already done.

I just can't get over it. i cant let it go.

my mind keeps going to the ""what if"" and it hurts so much. I feel like i made de wrong choice, even though I dont see it going anywhere if i would have had it. the baby would have had a father who didnt want it, who hated its mother. but then... dont loads of people grow up fucking fine without a dad, or without parents that are together. couldnt i just have found help to stop smoking weed and tabaco? if i would have really tried, wouldnt i have been able to do this?

fwtnhb,MentalHealthSupport,1586296725.0,For most of my life i have been homeless on and off due to my fathers mental illness he's tried to murder me on various occasions.However recently i have discovered that being away from them was the best thing that could have happened to me.The issues with my family stem from generational poverty substance abuse violence and general ignorance as well as just being horrible people to their core.I am by no means a saint but every thing i have ever done every act of violence or crime for me was an act of self preservation or to meet a basic need usually food.For years i dreamed of being with my family united but now all i want to do is be away from them and never see them again. In my family for the most part with the exception of this generation  there has never been a generation in which a child hasn't murdered a parent or a parent murdered a  child. So much has happened that it would be impossible to write all of it down. So instead i will simplify the main reason I am leaving.I have many sister and all of them have been raped. It  happened when they where children this past year my sister made a report and left.Her pastor a man we had known for years told her not to make things up twice when she tried to go to him on two separate years.The rapist where part of the congregation.This was the church my family attended.Instead of kicking out the rapist who had access to small children while attending this pastor and his wife chose to allow them to continue their membership.This peoples son was also accused of molesting the little girls in the congregation but got away with it when a victim declined to press charges .You would think my parents would have left the church and never have attended but they chose to keep attending as well as my older brother who has many small children. My  sister did on of the bravest things possible she came forward to hopefully prevent the next generation my nephew from becoming victims.Instead she was treated like a mangy animal by my parents and her older brother who said he washed his hands of the situation.To make matters worse he still attends with my innocent nephews and nieces.I went to my parents home and began to stay with them a little ago before all this happened and i knew of it but i found out about it.My mother had the pastor who had covered for my sisters rapist there   i let them know what sick and repugnant creatures they where and i let my mother know she wasn't one what mother would allow those fucking animals near her family ever again.Thats when i finally realized that i had to be away from these people.I have done many things i am not proud off but i could never do such evil things as these.The reason being that when i was about 13 i was forced to make a choice on a winter night life or death and i chose to live she was an adult i was a child thats all ill say about my choice.At the moment i dont have any money but im trying to lose weight to join the army i want to move way from them to from my family  i need a car and a place to stay until i drop weight and can join.Im just tired now im tired of being surrounded by monsters im tired of being treated like im an asshole because i refuse to accept such dispicable  actions. Everytime  i discover new information about my family its more horrible information.I have no one to turn to so i just work on myself its really dificult sometimes knowing those evil people will never be punished.This is just a small snapshot maybe less than a percent of all the horrible things ive endured.I just want to find peace because i still beleive life is beautiful i see its beauty in this next generations eyes unfortunately i know im powerless to protect them which is why my sister left and why im leaving to find peace hopefully ive rather go thousand of miles away to a foreign war and risk death surrounded by strangers because itll be the closest to home ill have ever [known.Id](https://known.Id) write it all out but their isnt enough room or time but if you guys have questions please send them but please dont make me a big thing on the internet im just here to let some of it out and hopefully get a little encouragement i have no money i need a car i was laid of like many people but honestly i just try to  find that piece of me that says ill make it out of here ill survive and ill be happy one day.,https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthSupport/comments/fwtnhb/im_choosing_to_leave_and_start_over_again/,Im choosing to leave and start over again,,10,2,1.0

I'm qualified as a Nutrition Therapist. And something that I can share is that our environment: 
- what we eat, drink, breathe and touch.
- where & how we live
- what we do
- what we perceive (real or imagined)

These things all have a direct effect on our DNA, and to avoid getting too complicated. It basically means that when our environmental load surpasses our genetic ability to adapt and cope, then diseases develop in the MIND, BODY, and SPIRIT (Spirit being a collection of both).

What I'm saying is that I have definitely noticed overall and sustained improvements in my overall mental health since I learned and applied this knowledge to my own life. And I've seen it improve the lives of others that were in worse situations that myself. 

So if anyone would like any help or advice please feel free to reach out.

ewpt06,MentalHealthSupport,1580483546.0,"I was walking home from work after a fairly tense shift.

When I finished work I planned to treat myself to a little something from my favourite stationary shop but when I went in I couldn't choose so I didn't buy anything. I left the shop and could see two tall men wearing black approaching people so I tried to avoid them.

As I tried to go around, one of them approached and stood right in front of me, blocking my way and as I said 'Please leave me alone' he says their selling wrist bands to raise awareness for mental health, i stepped around him and he responded to my asking him to leave me alone by raising his voice and saying 'No, i won't ' i then continue to walk and he then shouts 'How dare you!'. 
I then stop in my tracks and he shouts again 'That's right, how dare you!'

At this point, for one, normally when I walk away from a total stranger on the street handing things out, asking them to please me alone would be enough, i have never felt so violated on the high street as i did at this point, so i did something that i literally never do and i turned back around. 

I said to him 'considering your chasing someone with bad anxiety up the high street, its pretty hypocritical when your supposed to be raising awareness for mental health'

I was and still am absolutely fuming, he then offered me one of the wristband but I said no and continued on my way, shaking like a leaf and almost in tears.

I was supposed to have a chilled self care afternoon off and I feel so tense I can't relax.

Was I right to react in that way? I never do that but part of me feels so angry and upset and the other part of me feels pretty proud of myself for actually saying something.

euwmp9,MentalHealthSupport,1580167944.0,"Okay, this is a long and complicated story involving
Me, Fianc√©, now deceased BFF (let's call her P), her SOB c*nt of a w*√∂re friend henceforth named as Bitch.

So to start this off, me and P have known each other since the end of 2011 and we got together in like March 2012, split up as friends in march 2013 even closer then we were as a couple.

We hung out everyday from 2011 'till December 2017 when I moved away, like half of our country away.
But we talked on the phone everyday, cammed and went up to visit some times.

P was also close with Bitch, I also knew her and at the time before these events transpired I saw her as a close friend (And so did she, well she said so at least, know I know it was a lie). Though I noticed something was off, P was always Goth/alternative/whatever you wanna call it, but during 2015 P and Bitch started spending almost all the time together, if P was with Bitch she wasn't allowed to call me or any other friend.
Bitch started changing P into a walking copy of herself! At first I ignored it since everyone can change their style, right?
But what got me convinced that she tried to control P's life was the fact that she was COMPLETELY different when she was with Bitch and herself with me and her old friends.

This is EXTREMELY IMPORTANT to this story! P had heart failure, severe heart problems that would never go away, she spent 2 months in a coma back in 2011 cuz her heart stopped from all her psychmeds.
Bitch was addicted to Benzos and strong opiates.
P had severe anxiety problems and was diagnosed with schizophrenia and ADD, because of her heart condition she obviously wouldn't get anymore Adderall on prescription but she accepted that and took her Benzos and sometimes codeine for chronic back pain. (Note: SOMETIMES took codeine).

Bitch (Whom is a registered psychiatric nurse like me) sees an opportunity, P wants back on the Adderall since she was a sober meth addict.. She started trading pills with P..
I noticed from what P told me that her heart kept getting worse and worse so I called Bitch and screamed at her to fkn stop.
She said she would but didn't...
Since I still thought we were friends I trusted her.

Fast forward 'till March -19.
Me and fianc√© are going on a 2 week vacation at P! We're so hyped and happy!
It's all we can think about!

I've just had surgery and take methadone since I was in chronic pain and got addicted to Oxycontin and don't want to relapse since I hade way over one year clean and sober.

When we're like half an hour from where P lives she calls me sounding extremely desperate looking for opioids? 
I was stunned and said that we'll talk 'bout it when we meet (I wanted to tell her NO in person since I know how fucking hard and horrible an opiod addiction is to shake).

Fast forward and we are at P's apartment, we're chilling, playing Xbox and eating brownies. I told her that there was no way in hell she would get anything off me and why. She shined up because I cared..
The aura in the room was off, like you know something is wrong but you don't know what..

I fell asleep after a long day of travel, and so did my fianc√© and P as well.
In the middle of the night I wake up by a gut wrenching scream.
P wasn't breathing...
I started CPR and my fianc√© called 911.. But it was too late..
She was DOA when the ambulance came..

This is where all hell breaks loose.
Obviously the cops show up since someone died.
But at first they're satisfied and leave with the ambulance.
I'm in a shock and totally blitzed on my Diazepam and relapsed on Oxy, my only true friend died in my fkn arms..

I went out in the winter night and smashed my methadone bottle because I thought that maybe, just maybe, she found it and killed herself with it. Regardless, I didn't want to see that shit again. I was certain she had OD on my methadone...

I realized that maybe the cops would come back and put me in jail since I'm labeld as an addict in their papers so I called Bitch and told her what had happened.
I also called a few others of her closest friends so they wouldn't have to wonder what happened.

Anyway, I go to jail for Involuntary Manslaughter, just because I had my own meds.
The charges didn't stick, but you have to realize that in my country jail means 23,5 hours per day in a 4 cubic feet cell.
I was jailed for 14 days.

When I got out it took over 6 months before all charges were dropped...
The reason?
This is where Bitch comes in.
She told the cops that I probably force fed her methadone and lots of Benzos!
That I probably cleared out her ATM-card, that me and P weren't really friends and that my fucking mother in law sold me methadone and pills!
And as if that weren't enough... She pulled the same bullshit with P's family... Resulting in severe death threats who still aren't over.. 
Just so she could steal clothes, expensive electronics and expensive makeup from P's apartment while we were locked up!


When I finally got the papers of what she told the cops, the autopsy report which cleared me to a whopping 1000%, I called P's mom (Who had by this time apologized to me for threatening my life and realized she draw conclusions way to fast) and told her that Bitch is the true reason P is dead. Since Bitch kept supplying P with amphetamines her heart got enlarged and that's the reason she died.
May I remind you that Bitch is a SPECIALIST NURSE in ADHD treatment!
I also tell all of those fuckers who keep threatening me and my fianc√© who's truly to blame.

Am I to blame?..

czs7yh,MentalHealthSupport,1567637760.0,"I'm new to this subreddit. I've created a throwaway account for identity reasons. This is my first time discussing my mental health issues on Reddit, but I've felt like I've started running out of options and resources as to where to get help.

I'm a college student. This year has been super rough and seems like it has been problem after problem. Last year (2018) my parents divorced and my grandmother passed away. This year, my mother unexpectedly passed away in early spring and there was a lot of family turmoil targeted at me and my father after she passed away. Her family is violent and cold, and I have tried my hardest to forget about them and what they have said.

Then, here at my university, there has been a lot of shakeups in our department. My mentor and favorite professor was let go and then I was let go from my position over the summer. There has been a lot of trouble getting adjusted to these changes, and I'm still struggling.

Probably the final straw, and the reason I bring this on Reddit, is I found out today that the therapist I've seen will no longer be seeing me as she feels she can no longer help me, and it would be in my best interest to go to a seasoned professional (she was a grad student.) The big issue here is that I have no health insurance and I'm currently unemployed, and my family can't help me.

I've scheduled an appointment to go to our school's counseling center, but I believe they can only see you three times before you have to go elsewhere.

I'm wondering what I can do to start getting back in the swing of things? My self-esteem has eroded (even before this whole mess I had low self-esteem issues), and my anxiety/depression is really starting to eat into my personal/professional/academic life. I no longer enjoy many of the things that I used to. I used to be really tuned in to the profession I'm studying for, but between loosing my job (where I was actually able to practice that profession) and everything in my personal life, it has been really hard to focus on classwork. I had a class over the summer that I was unable to complete, but the professor gave me an extension to finish it this month. I haven't even started.

Over the summer (when things started taking a turn for the worse,) I thought about possibly putting my school on hold and taking a couple years off to work and get my mental health back in check. But I don't think I want to do that - I really want to get my degree so that I can actually get out, start working and possibly dig myself out of this financial hole. It seems like a large chunk of my anxiety is caused by having little to no money.

In the interim, I'm currently looking for a job. (Unfortunately, jobs are scarce here and I'm trying to avoid fast food due to previous experiences that may exacerbate some parts of my mental health issues.) One of my biggest concerns is trying to get health insurance so that I can go back to seeing a counselor, psychiatrist. I was prescribed Celexa and took it daily prior to loosing my insurance, and it seemed to help a lot. Also seeing a counselor helped a lot immediately, but between sessions I would have a lot of issues.

The counselor/psychiatrist I saw before loosing my insurance has a sliding pay scale, but since I'm unemployed I don't think it'll do any good.

Any help would be **greatly** appreciated. I'll try to respond as quickly as possible, although this is a throwaway account so I don't receive notifications. Thanks.

i understand this (topic) because I‚Äôve recognized (this) and (this) and therefore (this) may happened because of (all of those observations) 

the problem with this pattern thing is that it makes me assume my life is a pattern as well.

because of this, i start assuming something bad will happen. and i guess thats normal to assume. everyone uses experiences to learn and try to avoid things. the problem is im really trying to just be more positive. these ‚Äúnegative‚Äù things wreck me and make me assume something bad will happen and because of my anxiety with that, i end up spiraling and maybe even leading myself back again to that ‚Äúpattern‚Äù that i ‚Äúassume would happen‚Äù. 

another is a make myself do certain ‚Äúthings/actions‚Äù in order to avoid ‚Äúan event‚Äù i completely assumed in my head and i think that if i dont do it, something bad will happen. 

ex: if i dont put my snake ring facing upwards then im going it have a bad day because the last time i didnt i had a bad day.

does anyone get what i mean? 

is this normal?

any advice would be amazing.

11jmond,MentalHealthSupport,1678072333.0,"Can I take constructive criticism? Generally, yes. However, getting criticized many times over little things gives me anxiety. That makes me angry because 1) I often times can‚Äôt escape the feeling of anxiety when criticized, 2) I try to be pretty agreeable to avoid displeasing people. So when that expectation isn‚Äôt met and people still criticize me, I get angry and resentful because it feels like there is nothing I can do to please them which makes me feel like there is no way to get away from my anxiety.

I also end up feeling like a victim which makes me feel weak and disempowered which I hate. This also makes me angry lol.

So my question is can I choose to not feel anxiety in situations like this, and how? If I can‚Äôt just choose not to feel it, how do I deal with it? What is the healthy end goal that I should have if ending the feeling of anxiety isn‚Äôt possible?

101gioe,MentalHealthSupport,1672676435.0,"#  There are many reasons why people might not take mental health seriously. Some people may not understand the importance of mental health, or they may believe that mental health problems are not as significant as physical health problems. Others may be in denial about their own mental health issues or may be reluctant to seek help because of stigma or fear of being judged. Some people may also be unsure of where to go for help or may not have access to mental health resources. Finally, some people may simply not know how to recognize when their mental health is suffering and may not realize that they need help.

#  Here are a few other reasons why people might not take mental health seriously:

# üëâLack of education: Some people may not fully understand what mental health is or how it can impact their lives. Without proper education, they may not realize the importance of taking care of their mental health.

# üëâMisconceptions: There are many misconceptions about mental health that can prevent people from taking it seriously. For example, some people may believe that mental health problems are a sign of weakness or that they can be overcome simply by willpower.

# üëâPrioritizing other responsibilities: It can be easy to prioritize work, school, and other responsibilities over mental health. This can lead people to ignore their own mental health needs.

# üëâDifficulty recognizing symptoms: Mental health problems can manifest in different ways, and it can be difficult to recognize the symptoms. As a result, people may not realize that they are experiencing a mental health issue and may not seek help.

# üëâStigma: Unfortunately, there is still a lot of stigma surrounding mental health, which can prevent people from seeking help. Some people may be afraid of being judged or misunderstood if they seek help for a mental health problem.

yzdz7d,MentalHealthSupport,1668870530.0,"So I‚Äôve (F19) been going to the same therapist for about four years. Our relationship has honestly gotten really close, and I always enjoyed this. Seeing her was always a highlight of my week. 
But recently there are some red flags. 

The biggest one being her ghosting me when I moved to college. It literally came out of nowhere. We had plans to have two meetings the week that I moved. During the previous weeks before I had been meeting with her way more than usual,  because we were preparing for my move. She was pretty much the only person that I had to talk to, and she was very aware of this. I didn‚Äôt hear from her for atleast two weeks. And I recently found out the only reason she messaged me was because my mom emailed her and asked her to. 

It was so bizarre and detrimental to my mental health. We had such a close relationship and she just made it so clear that she was going to talk to me a bunch and when I hear from her I was shocked. 

And once I did hear from her it‚Äôs because she called me like 10 times and spammed my phone and left me a bunch of weird text messages. And when I didn‚Äôt answer she texted me my first and middle name with a period scolding me like my mom. And I have no idea how she even knew my middle name. And then she said ‚Äú I don‚Äôt want to sound to stalkerish but I have tomorrow off‚Äù then I tell her the day I can come back and meet with her to which she responded ‚Äúok 10 am you‚Äôre down. To be fair the stalking came out of a place of love when your mom reached out to me. üòÇ. Next time I‚Äôm driving myself to Ames to check on you .. take it one step farther‚Äù  like acting as if I ghosted her and she was worried about me instead of the other way around. 

I almost stopped seeing her after this happened but since then her energy had just been off. I feel like she‚Äôs there to hear my life gossip and not to be my therapist. I even told her what my biggest problem is and that I know it connects everything and she never brought it up again. I‚Äôve been seeing her for four years yet haven‚Äôt even told her the beginning on my trauma because I feel uncomfortable. As soon as I get there she immediately like steers it to a conversation instead of like talking ab my issues. 

So now let‚Äôs talk ab the small things that have added up. I really want a professionals opinion as well to see if she was being normal or not. 
 
Just recently I told her I had been crying because my sisters on her period and it makes me pms bc I don‚Äôt have a period and our bodies still sync and then she starts saying she‚Äôs on her period too and just keeps saying it and saying I‚Äôm synced with her and making it weird. 

- She always told me she loved me and how I was her favorite and even would schedule me on Fridays which was her day off because ‚Äúshe loved me so much‚Äù 
 
- ever since I first met her she always asked me if I would come babysit her kids and I always tell her I hate babysitting and she still always brings it up and when said my sister likes to babysit she literally just llike changed the subject

- she tells me about her infertility issues and asks me where I would send my kids to school all the time so she can figure out where to send hers (adopted if ur wondering bc I mention infertility ) 

- one time she brought her kid and he sat on the floor between us and talked the whole session and I just played with him 

- wanted my new address to send me a fidget gift even tho I saw her in person 
 
- always says she‚Äôll drive yo my house if I ghost her ( 2 1/2 hours away )

yyrhmd,MentalHealthSupport,1668797413.0,"Im in my mid 30s. This ""condition"" has been with me for more than 10 years now, and it seems to be very slowly and steadily increasing in intensity. It's very very hard to describe, which is why I have never been able to get any help, I just don't know what to say. Usually when I tell people about it they don't seem to think it's a big deal, but this is because I can't really articulate what it feels like. It feels like nothing. And I'm not unhappy, I'm not in pain, I can function just as well as most people, I just feel nothing. I feel like I could go on like this forever, but sometimes I tell myself that something must be wrong.

I don't have good days or bad days, every day is identical. My mood does not change and my experience does not fluctuate. I don't have ""episodes"" or ""chapters"", it's just like one, infinite blackness that has no features, nothing whatsoever that can be described.

**I can only describe it in negative terms:**

* No interest in the future
   * I don't want kids or a relationship, I don't see this changing
   * I don't want to travel or gain new experiences
   * I don't want to progress my career
   * Life ahead seems unnecessarily, excruciatingly long, it's like having to sit in the cinema long after the movie has ended with nothing going on anymore
   * When people talk about what they want to achieve, where they want to be 10 years from now, their goals, their dreams, it feels so *incredibly* alien to me, and it makes me think there is something terribly wrong with me. But it is just by comparison that I feel this way. When I don't talk to people, I forget how weird this is.
* I have a perpetual urge to leave everything in order, everything clean and organized, with no loose ends remaining, as if I was always ready to die.
   * But don't get me wrong, I don't feel suicidal and I don't want to die, I just can't find a better way to describe this. Maybe I could describe it like this: I constantly keep myself in a state where if I ever got hit by a bus or my life unexpectedly ended, I would have nothing to regret, nothing left to do, no one to apologize to, no one to say goodbye to, nothing left on my bucket list, no achievement left unattained, no dreams left unfulfilled. For some reason I feel like I'm done living and I'm just using my remaining time to tie off all the loose ends.
   * This is why  I don't want to start a family or start a new job or experience new things, because I don't want to have new loose ends to tie off.
* I cannot bring myself to watch a movie or listen to a song
   * Doing these things feels like a chore, like wasting time, but not because I would spend that time doing something better.
   * It's like exercising: most people would rather do nothing than to exercise, out of laziness. Well I feel like that with things people find enjoyable, like watching a movie or listening to music.
* No enjoyment in the small things of life
   * This is probably the worst symptom actually, since life is made up of small things.
   * I can't just sit down and look at a beautiful landscape and ""feel"" something. It's just a beautiful landscape, so what?
   * Things like decorations feel empty and pointless. Making my home feel ""cozy"" is not something that's available to me. It's a room with objects that serve a purpose. Everything is extremely cold and *soulless*. Yeah, *without a soul*. My entire life is like that.
   * You know when you're driving home at night alone, listening to a song and it's raining and it just has some cool ""ambience"" or ""atmosphere""? Well that is completely foreign to me.
   * You know when it's a hot summer night and crickets are chirping, and everything is okay? It does nothing for me.
   * You know that comforting feeling when someone hugs you when you're sad? I don't.
   * You know when everything is bad and you listen to your favorite song and it makes you feel like everything is okay for some reason, like the song understands you, like there is something more beyond your petty problems because of how perfect that song is for you in this moment? For me they're just sounds with no meaning or significance whatsoever.
* Can't feel emotions towards people
   * I love my family but I feel nothing towards them. Or more like I *know* I love them on a logical level but I don't *feel* anything on an emotional level, none whatsoever.
   * I have great friends but it would never occur to me to meet up with them or to spend time with them if they didn't ask first. It's another chore that takes energy and time with no benefit.
   * I don't really enjoy spending time with people. It does nothing for me. I usually cancel most social plans if I can.
* I feel like and function like a machine
   * I go to work because that's what I have to do, and it poses no problems
   * I eat or cook or clean because I have to, but again, I don't feel reluctant to do these things
   * Strangely, I have no trouble doing the things I have to do. But it's impossible to do anything I don't have to do.
   * I can get up in the morning, I can do anything without issues. Nothing is difficult. I don't struggle with motivation if the thing in question is necessary. Depressed people often say they can't get up in the morning or they can't shower or clean or make food or go to work. I can do all those things. What I can't do is *everything else*.
   * I have no trouble doing the boring, necessary things of life that many people struggle with. I have amazing spreadsheets to calculate my taxes and my home is clean, organized, I cook a different meal every day, my clothes are clean, I floss every day. It doesn't feel like a chore. But I have trouble doing the fun, enjoyable things in life that I'd do for myself. *Doing anything that isn't needed* feels like a chore. It's like reverse laziness?

ygsfia,MentalHealthSupport,1667071687.0,"Hello Users of Reddit,

First of all, thank you for the time you use to read my story, I appreciate it.
I used to be a joyful person until I got a bad head injury, since that day life just hasn't been the same for me. I've felt more lonely and lost than I could've ever imagined. I've been dealing with short term memory loss for a while now and I don't think that I'll ever recover from it.
After my first relationship ended I started smoking pot and didn't take care of myself, ofcourse that didn't help my head at all.
At that time my health got worse.
I've started bleeding out of my rectum when I used the toilet.
4 years later I found the courage to tell my girlfriend at that time what long lasting problems I had.
She helped me to open up and get help, sadly she broke up with me.
I visited the hospital and had to stay for about 2 weeks.
Now we are at the part that is the hardest for me to tell... they found something that is a pre-stage for cancer.
I started questioning life and the meaning behind it.
Sadly I didn't come to a conclusion.
My next visit in the hospital is the 17.11.2022, one day before my birthday. 
I slowly start noticing how empty I really am at this point.
I don't know what I'm gonna do with my life if I really should have cancer.
I'm scared and alone.
It hurts to see others your age achieving their dreams.
Thank you for reading my thoughts.
I hope you have a wonderful day",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthSupport/comments/ygsfia/hey_im_a_guy_20_that_wants_to_tell_part_of_his/,"Hey, I'm a guy (20) that wants to tell part of his story.",,8,11,0.91

I need help. A former friend died via ending her life, but before that, she was a terrible person towards me. She made up rumors, exposed our DMs of VERY private conversations to people who dislike me, made me cut off people I liked, told me to give up on the things I write because she didn't like them anymore, and let people say things about me while we were friends. I still feel so angry, but I can't feel that way without feeling bad. But I can't let these feelings go if I don't feel them. But I can't feel them without feeling guilty. Originally l tried to cope by saying she faked it and living in a delusion. That was shitty of me and I've stopped that habit ever since. I don't need help with that anymore. 

 Part of this is because my friend was also friends with her when she was still here. This friend never let me express my anger, telling me that I was toxic when I did. They also justified everything that she'd done until I asked them to please just stop talking about her. Then, this friend said they blamed me for her death after I'd relapsed into cutting because I blamed myself. They knew about the relapse. They blamed me because I didn't want to speak to her after the first attempt because I knew she disliked me. I wanted her to survive and I knew that if I came in, I could jeopardize that. I knew she needed to be around people she liked, so I stayed back. I thought that if I got involved, I'd only make it worse. They knew about all of this, but told me that it was my fault for making her wait and my fault for cutting her off. Then, they disappeared for two months. Then they came back and called me out for shitty behavior, which is good. I'm glad they did. But then when I tried to explain why and apologized, they told me to stop making excuses and that I was disgusting for thinking it could be excused, even though I never said that. I apologized three times and admitted that I was wrong and stupid because of my own inability to cope and that I would do better, but I just needed help.

We haven't spoken since because I won't log onto Discord, where my friends and I also talk. I'm scared to log on and see something terrible again. I'm scared that everyone thinks I'm a bad person now. What scares me even more is what if they're right. What do I do?  Am I bad person? I feel like a bad person. How do I let go? Why is my friend being this way with me?

I go here because I've gone everywhere I can go. Self-care apps, therapy chatbots, free support websites. Nothing and nobody helped. This is my last resort because I'm 15 and I can't talk to anybody irl about this aside from my cousin and my best friend.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthSupport/comments/yc1lj2/i_need_help_tw_suicide/,I need help (TW: Suicide),,9,20,0.92

However, sometimes I don't feel like talking to my friends, either, and they've never done anything to hurt me. I mean, we had our petty arguments when we were kids, but that's way behind us now. And yet, when they text me, sometimes it takes forever for me to text back.

To say it was weird is to put it mildly. I hit diagnosed with bipolar and general anxiety (which I already had anxiety). My world kinda flipped. I didn‚Äôt know how I could be bipolar, and how they described why they diagnosed me on the paper report was delusions of talent and faking pain, mood swings, and low self esteem. I texted my therapist because it seemed weird to me, since I don‚Äôt know how they got delusion from my general aches and pains and me saying I think I‚Äôm talented (all a paper yes or no quiz).

My therapist called me a few hours later in rage mode. She described bipolar and I didn‚Äôt fit 90% of the criteria, and said I have PTSD and long covid (stuff I already knew) and bipolar from a 300 question written quiz with no room for explanations and an emmediate computer generated diagnosis was bullshit.

\- I need time for myself, all alone without anyone, I really really enjoy being alone

\- the last few years where I visited my grandparents where always stressful

\- It's not my job to my anyone in this family happy

\- social anxiety cannot take this

\- I have to practice for art school and for a possible career, 10- 14 days are too much to not practice

\- learn theory for my drivers license

\- I hate the food, I'm vegan so it's hard and always something my grandma argues with me about

\- how are my plants supposed to survive for two weeks without anyone taking care of them?

The first time he acted out was 7 months into our relationship. Our relationship was healthy and good, we went on our first vacation around 5 month of dating and it was perfect. We disagreed on things but never fought. Then he started pushing me away for 3 months and when I was ready to call it quits, he mustered up the courage to tell me what has been going on (he never physically cheated, only downloaded apps and talked to other people). 

He was going to therapy before him and I started dating but stopped because he was embarrassed. After that incident he started his meetings again and soon stopped, saying that he was strong enough without them and didn‚Äôt need it anymore. We fought constantly for 2 months and finally got to a place of understanding that we‚Äôre a team and stopped fighting. 

We had finally got our relationship back to a safe place after his first acting out, enough to plan a  trip to celebrate his upcoming accomplishment. Enough to have my sister and her bf find a new living place so he can move in with me. 

A month ago, he relapsed. This time he physically cheated with the opposite gender. From time to time I would think about it and work myself up with anger. With that said, the trip was canceled (hotel, car rental, and flight) 

I‚Äôm a very open minded person when it comes to mental health and decided to stay with him. 

But I am having struggling of my own. Those incidences has made me develop chronic anxiety. I work nights on weekends (cause I‚Äôm in class on weekdays) and  both events happened while I was at work. So I get panic attacks whenever it hits the weekend. He‚Äôs been trying to help by letting me install a camera at his place and has turned on his location. He has started his meetings and has been very consistent with them. I‚Äôm just afraid that when he is trigged (usually stress), he‚Äôll act out again. I just can‚Äôt go through that again, I‚Äôm going through it now and it‚Äôs so painful. 

I know we‚Äôre both in a rough place and we‚Äôre still trying to work on it as a team but at time I feel like I‚Äôve lost a part of myself. 

I have recently found myself questioning my place on earth because I feel so empty. I express my struggles with him (telling him I have been feeling melancholy, not my questioning) and I feel like it has gotten to the point where I feel like he‚Äôs annoyed with my struggles.

I'm having a hard time communicating with her. She talked to me for over an hour once and told me half of her life story (and it was pretty bad), but usually I can get her only to text and she ignores my calls.

What can I do to help? I want to go see her, but I'm not sure if it will upset her even more if I go to her house and talk to her mom without her permission so I can see her.

Any suggestions? She's been similar to this before and she struggles everyday even when she is feeling better.

When I was 14 I had an 8-hour long open-heart surgery and it had great impact on my youth and life nowadays. A month after the surgery the doctors found out I had 2 strokes as well, remember I was 14 at the time. The disease has never been diagnosed by somebody else in the whole world, that means I‚Äôm one in 7 billion, and I was always told to live with that.

so. I grew up with Asperger    with parents who had no conception of autism existing, they were both born in late 40s and had the  perception of a much older  generation...

i got the  shit bullied out of me  for being different. that caused serious  trauma. (picture being hunted through a forest with air rifles not airsoft. air rifles. metal pellets by 18 year olds when you're 9)

it got so bad was hiding cracked bones. between 11 and 12 years old i didn't  go  out or talk to any other peer outside of school . total hermit mode.  it completely fucked my mental health and made it  extremely difficult even on top of asperges to  trust/interact with other human beings..  my parents were oblivious and in thier own world.

struggled through working teenage years  not knowing i had asperges but  still suffering  all the things it brings.  gaslighted by parents into thinking i was saving us from poverty

then parents abandoned me and i got let down by  the people meant to help  citizens advice told me ""we cant help until you're on the street"" - which was bullshit but in my autism i took it as fact.

as a direct result of that I had to stay with a ""friend"" someone who  turned out to be a narcissistic sociopath... stole every bit of money i had from welfare. spent it all on drugs. Then kicked me out and accused me  to everyone i knew of  being freeloader who didn't pay for anything....(i literally paid for all gas an electric while i was there, everything else they took and spent on weed and drugs)

still no help from council/government services/non existent mental health services.

then fell in love with someone who turned out to be severely mentally unwell and have severe baggage from previous (abusive) relationships.  ended up in an abusive (psychological/emotional/ financially) for 6 years with them . (but they were too ill to even understand the behaviour was  abuse and they controlled all my money so i couldn't leave)

finally got back financial independence beginning of this year and  have been trying to get housing sorted.... but that's like fucking pulling teeth but with none of the joy.

the council (uk local government)   dont do anything unless you ring them and pester. i got told to cease ringing them  or they wouldn't help me, and they were already doing everything they could.  stopped ringing them... then rang them  3 months later after no contact from them... they had done nothing and were about to take me off the  ""homelessness prevention"" list. because i hadn't rang them and their ""duty of care"" was about to end.

the people everyone pays taxes to, so that in the event you need  help they help you........ expect you to  do all the work yourself. and despite me telling them i have severe mental health problems and cant work/function/interact properly as a result. severe aspergers which limits my ability to cope with  figuring out how THE FUCK to deal with this. they wont help. it's supposed to be THEIR  job.  to help their fuckign people.   otherwise why the fuck do we pay taxes.....

I've been bounced around  services liek hostels  endlessly..(but i acknowledge the pandemic made many homeless so hostels are like   exclusive hotels atm) fucked about and let down by the people  who are supposed to help. WHILE dealing with all the severe shit  all of this has caused in my mind. and Aspergers.

i've been doing everything i can as an individual to cope, meditation, yoga, dont touch caffeine,   exercise, good diet  active lifestyle (ive picked up an obsessive love of long distance kayaking, which i think might in part be so i don't have to  deal with reality. rivers are peaceful.)

He had bipolar disorder and potentially other diagnoses I‚Äôm unaware of. At the time, I was 13 years old. When I inevitably found out the truth, my parents were confronted with the thought that perhaps, while I was still young, I was old enough to understand the situation if addressed properly. Not that they had any choice, as I‚Äôd already been told the truth by a forgetful doorman.

Eventually I attempted suicide but failed, and then last year, on top of the pandemic, I got hit by a car. Now, I‚Äôm always in pain and car related events and conversations tend to trigger me, as does talk of nooses specifically. 

Last Wednesday, I visited a buddy of mine. Before I got to her place, an acquaintance we shared had come over, and not long after showing up, had started having a breakdown. When I arrived, I did some exercises my therapist had suggested to help my own anxiety. It seemed to sooth her but she ultimately broke down again and this time was worse. She screamed at the top of her lungs in the same deafening screech I had when I was hit by that car and she started scratching me. Her nails dug into my arms, face, legs, and chest, all while screaming. She also tackled my shoulder, which is still in pain From the accident, and clocked my ear hard enough that it still hurts, which also messes with my lock jaw. 

So much is on my mind and I‚Äôm shutting down. So many of my triggers are lighting up like a Christmas tree. I‚Äôm dissociating and I cried really hard at the end of a shift that didn‚Äôt have any hiccups - it was 9 hours but it was an energizing shift.

So, I've wanted some help for a long time and I finally feel like I found the perfect provider.  I dissociate during intimacy and so relationships have been off the table for me since my last one ended several years ago.  (I'm fairly certain that's what it is--it took a long time to convince myself I wasn't just choosing to be weird, but I definitely can't control it, I can't move, I've done it with every single partner, I feel like I've left myself, I sometimes feel like a child again, I can get very unstable very fast, it's weird and hard to describe and not like anything else in the world).  I'm lonely and tired of having to self-isolate, but wouldn't want to put anyone through these episodes I can only half control.  So, problem solved, right?

Well, I worry about making up I'm not sure anything traumatic ever happened to me.  I do not know why I've struggled with this (and feeling very anxious about being touched) my whole life.  I had a minor sexual violation in early adulthood and some low-grade emotional abuse as a child, but nothing more than that to explain why I'm like this.  

Admittedly I've always wondered, as sometimes I've ""remembered"" disturbing but inconsistent things while high, I had sleep paralysis/nightmares and bedwetting/infections as a toddler, wanted to start dressing like a boy around 3-4 and didn't want anyone calling me pretty.  I know I'll never know for sure, but a big part of me thinks I honestly just want an alibi for being like this and I'm grasping at straws that just aren't there.  

The new therapist doesn't believe my symptoms would happen for no reason and has told me she ""thinks something happens.""  I'm terrified about getting lost in my mind about something that never even happened.  I feel dirty and disingenuous for co-opting the experiences and treatments of actual abuse survivors.  At the same time, I want the dissociative episodes to stop.  All providers I've found want to dig in my past for a cause (much more than this one).  I don't think it's good for me to obsess over and dig for something that's probably not there.  Any thoughts?  I'd appreciate it.

nqjmnb,MentalHealthSupport,1622633282.0,"I am a 16 year old male suffering from severe depression and anxiety, over the past year my mental health has deteriorated, with a family history of mental health issues I should have seen it coming. I think it all started with the first lockdown in NZ, it was a really difficult time for my family and I, and it was then when my sister had an attempt at her own life. Being 15 at the time this was really difficult to process, and I still feel the trauma of seeing the ambulance at my house, and my sister being taken out of a stretcher. I had to go to school keeping that to myself, I read her note one morning before I had to go to school, and it was one of the hardest things I‚Äôve been through in my life. I found that I never told anyone about how I felt and all of my emotions got bottled up, my parents have focused of my sister, so excessively that I felt neglected, they didn‚Äôt know how I felt. My mother said I didn‚Äôt understand what they had been through in the past year, and that really broke me. Because I had understood all too well. I really need help and support but I do not know what to do to help myself get out of this headspace. I want to disappear. How can I get into a position where I can no longer suffer from anxiety and depression.

It's on all streaming services and it has its very own YouTube channel but first  I want to tell you guys why I started this. Personally for the last eight years of my life, I suffered from depression, self loathing, insecurities etc. And with that, I knew absolutely nothing about self love, self worth or even happiness. A year ago I knew I had to change my ways or it was going to be over for me. So I started a mission of digging up all my skeletons and properly burying them where they belong and I just want to say this last year and a half have been extraordinary and I finally see the light. I no longer cry at night and I feel true happiness every day. But with mental health, depression and self harm, I knew I wasn't the only person out there in the world feeling these things and having these thoughts, so I decided to make ""One time for a good time"" because even through my roughest of time. I knew how good it would have felt to walk with someone through all of the darkness and I want to be that for people. The person people can come to in the darkest of times and get advice, laugh or listen to me tell a stupid story. There's too many people out there struggling with mental health and I want to do my part in the world by getting this podcast out there and saving others. I hope this can help one of you out there or Maybe you know someone you can send it too but life is too short and I think we should spend our waking hours having fun and living our best lives.

I was trying to make friends and be nice and make this a good place for me. Of course I have pretty bad anxiety so I was always worried what people were thinking and trying to do the right thing and that makes me mess up or not see what I should see.

Today, I thought maybe I upset a coworker so I asked another if I had done anything and she assured me I hadn‚Äôt, so I finally relaxed and was able to remind myself that I was using distorted thinking. But I did do something I could tell had annoyed my boss, but I realized she miss understood why I had said what I said and thought me taking a second was cluelessness on what to do. I figured hey its fine nothing wrong, I have been here for three weeks and its busy maybe shes just stressed. 

So I get done, trying to hurry so I can go to a store that closes soon, but still not forget anything. And as I walk out and she follows me she says she needs to talk to me.

Essentially she tells me I say things that other workers and customers find jarring and that I seem very nervous all the time. And that she doesn‚Äôt think the nervousness is a good match for the fast paced environment. She said it may just be my personality but that it just won‚Äôt work out. 

And that was it, no explanation on what this meant or ever telling me hey don‚Äôt do this or  any kind of warning. 

The only thing for me is that I have always struggled to make friends, and to be someone who doesn‚Äôt come off weird or say things that makes people cringe, or think I am being a bitch.

I froze up, and I had to back down after wanting to speak about his life. I felt emotionless. People asked me why I didn't say anything, I just responded saying I didn't know.

About two years ago I went through the darkest days of my life, dealing with the unresolved coping of the loss of my father at age 15, as well as different difficult to deal with traumatic aspects of my childhood (involving years of being bullied from a couple of older kids).

I decided that I needed therapy/counseling after long months (and in part, years) of struggling with this on my own. And now, I made a video to share the experience of psychotherapy and the positive effects it's had on me and my mental health.

I wanted to share this, because it might help someone who is still unsure about seeking help or what to expect from working with a mental health professional.

Especially during these times, people are lonelier and feeling more depressed than ever, so I hope that I can add a little something to the cause of mental health awareness/help.

&#x200B;

I made this video also in part thanks to my psychotherapist, who has encouraged me before to share my work with some mental health organisations, because she feels like a lot of people could benefit from hearing more stories. (I released a short film last year about coping with the loss of my dad.)

&#x200B;

Anyways, here is the link to the video. Feel free to have a look or sending it to someone you think it might help on their journey.

ksjxos,MentalHealthSupport,1610045830.0,"Last night I could not go to sleep. I was reminded of an event in my life and suddenly all the hard memories I experienced came back to me in one night.

I had a really turbulent childhood. My parents were immigrants and always working. Their parenting style was always inconsistent. Some of the time they were always sleeping and watching TV to decompress. They worked hard to provide everything for our family, but I think I many ways they did not provide the emotional reassurance and dependability needed to be a secure child. If I was sad or upset, instead of speaking rationally with me, my dad would resort to the old way of Asian disciplining - the belt and slipper. Instead of having a two-way conversation about problems in my life, they would lecture me and tell me I was wrong all the time. They were also very protective of me. I was never allowed to play with other children at their homes, and the only times were during family parties or Christians meetings. They didn't socialize me properly. Didn't teach me about compassion or understanding.

When I first started elementary school, I really wanted to kids to like me. Desperately so but I started off on the wrong foot because I went around telling people that I wanted to do the ""Titanic"" with some boy. That incident followed me and earned me a ticket to Bullyland.

I spent most of elementary through high school years being bullied. So much of elementary school was trying to win friends over and prove myself to be cool enough to be popular. I went about it in the wrong ways. Just like the bullies who would verbally and emotionally attack me, I tried to get people to go against another girl in my grade. I would gossip about her and spread rumors about her in a failed attempted to gain power. I also tried to become friends with the tough girls in school, but in the end they became my tormentors.

By the eight grade, I had stopped all together. Something within me shifted and I became friends with the two most unpopular girls in my school. Primarily because I knew were they sweet and kind at the end of the day.

High school everything continued but my bullies expanded to more people. Bullies are really good at networking! They recap new people on your life in elementary and those new people jump in on the fun of trying to humiliate you.

My demeanor changed in high school. I kept my head down and remained silent throughout all of the bullying. I tried to pretend I didn't hear them when clearly I did and everyone else. Because of this lifestyle, I performed poorly as a student. I would go home, eat, and sleep immediately. I would just be in my room wanting to be alone all the time. I also had difficulty maintaining a healthy relationship with my two friends. I would find myself being a bully to one of them or try to put them against each other. We all stuck together though.

When it was senior year, another shifted happened. I knew the end of my high school days were coming to an end, so I was focusing on glowing up. I lost weight and started dressing how I wanted to dress. I also stood up to bullies in gym classes even though it involves cursing. Maybe in a way it was to show them that I didn't give a sh\*\* anymore.

Post High School, I was never bullied again. But the wounds left extreme social anxiety and the inability to maintain healthy relationships. It's taken so many years of my life to see how my childhood trauma has affected me in my adult life. Even though I can socialize 110% better than when I was younger and I can empathize and be there for others, I still struggle to maintain healthy friendships. I always find a flaw, get annoyed, resentful, and then the friendship loses its strength. I was very confrontational in my early 20s because of being taken advantage throughout my childhood. But now in my mid to late 20, I'm trying to relearn how to be confident and compassionate to myself and others. I always feel alone or not good enough or worthy enough, and it truly stems from my formative years. To this day, I'm always trying to find peace in my self-esteem.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthSupport/comments/ksjxos/i_f28_was_bullied_and_a_bully_childhood_bullying/,"I [F,28] was bullied and a bully.

I could barely get out of bed; it took several hours to do so. 

I have a lot to do (moving to another place to stay this week, have xmas shopping etc.. as well as chasing up financial stuff, and finding a new job) and it takes so much strength and energy to do anything - I don't even have the energy to shower right now.

I‚Äôm in so much pain after a break-up and leaving a country I adored living in, and my mind constantly gives me a hard time about all the mistakes I've made, and keeps reminding me of memories and places from my life before.

I never got the chance for closure with my ex - things had gotten pretty toxic from both ends and he just vanished on me. 
The whole relationship was a mess, but I have such bittersweet memories of the person I had the most immensely close connection with and the good times we did have. I've never been so close to another soul before and there's now just a big gaping hole. I miss conversation, I miss cuddles and kisses and I miss feeling like I knew where y life was going.

My psychiatrist and therapist have both come to the conclusion I have lots of physical health issues NOT caused by my mental health which I tried to figure out almost two years ago so although I am continuing therapy with my therapist my psych says there‚Äôs not a ton left to do because we‚Äôre putting a temporary bandaid for something that needs stitches. Doctors completely wrote me off even though tests were coming back abnormal. We get a new insurance on the first so I‚Äôm going to basically start all over and have to redo all the test which just exhausts me to think about, I‚Äôm tired of having to tell people I‚Äôm not lying and that I‚Äôm in real insane pain. It just all feels impossible and like nothing has the potential to change. I‚Äôve been told to wait my whole life to finally be happy and I just don‚Äôt feel like it‚Äôs possible. I have the best guy and he keeps telling me he couldn‚Äôt survive without me but that‚Äôs the only reason I‚Äôm hanging on and that isn‚Äôt healthy. Everyone keeps just telling me it will get better and I don‚Äôt want to he ungrateful for peoples help but it ends up feeling minimizing and I feel bad because I know people want to help. I just, it‚Äôs really bad and with all the ‚Äúchanges‚Äù that will happen it‚Äôs still years before potentially things even out and even then I know it‚Äôs different day same shit. I can‚Äôt be hospitalized right now because my guys hours were cut so I‚Äôm kinda it money wise, plus my job has so few people it would put them out. I just don‚Äôt know what to do.

ke6s3p,MentalHealthSupport,1608114268.0,"A digital detox¬†refers to a period of time during which a person refrains from using electronic devices connected to the Internet, such as smartphones and computers. Moreover, a digital detox is an opportunity to reduce stress and focus more on interaction with others. And it can also help prevent addiction to tech devices.

In addition, a digital detox provides time to experience nature, get physical exercise, and practice mindfulness. Unplugging on a regular basis helps us maintain a healthy balance between IRL (‚Äúin real life‚Äù) activities and the digital world.

A large body of research is validating this correlation. For example, a study of 38 teenagers tracked changes in the brain associated with smartphone addiction. Researchers determined the teens‚Äô addiction levels and mental health via questionnaires. Consequently, they found that the addicted teens had significantly higher scores in depression, anxiety, insomnia, and impulsive behavior.

kcu373,MentalHealthSupport,1607936059.0,"Sorry for the weird title, but it's a rough summary of what just happened. 

A bit warning, this talks about suicide, r*pe, eating disorders, anxiety and depression. 

A bit of background, in highschool I was in an abusive relationship and was trapped in it for 2 years. He raped me, physically hurt me, mentally controlled me until I felt empty and numb and he had the remote to my mind, all while I got into 2 different eating disorders because he constantly commented on my weight. (I used to be a bit heavier). 
Also during this, my parents were more worried about my grades and not much else. One good example of this, it took a year to convince my mom that my ears were getting more and more clogged and my hearing was getting worse, and it wasn't even me that convinced her, my school did a hearing test for the Special ED students and they thought it might've broke because I heard nothing. They called my mom and she finally took me in, with the doctor saying my ears was the most clogged he had ever seen. 

During this time, I used my parents shower instead of the main bathroom because I wanted to feel more like an adult. But the shower head me dive into my mind and my thoughts of suicide were the worse then where I had one of my few suicide attempts in there but I never told anyone, and no one came to look for me.

Now it's 4 years later, I can't take a shower in there without it all flooding back and taking weeks to recover. 
My brother was recently exposed to Covid, bit so far he's not showing any symptoms. But my parents made the main bathroom his, and are making my sister and I use their bathroom in the meantime. I thought I could handle it, and it's been long enough from my traumatic experiences but... I'm still apparently hurting, badly... It's gotten bad where I would wait more than a few days to shower to avoid that bathroom as much as I can, but I know I stink, and I know my parents would think I'm getting over dramatic...I got grounded for having an anxiety attack from going to a restaurant my abuser took me to a lot, saying that I ruined their day... 

I also can't take being yelled, lectured it even given in in trouble well. I go into a panic/anxiety attack, fight-or-flight mindset, or with my parents I just ""shut off"" when they even just in the room. I've learned to fake emotions around them, just to make them happy.

But tonight it just all crumbled like a Jenga tower. I'm trying to move out, but because of Covid it's gotten harder to find a place. I've tried online therapy, but when my parents found out, they pressured and pressured me to thinking the reliable therapy was not reliable and that I didn't need it. People always get mad at me for forgetting so much, even forgetting parts of time, and trying to remember events just comes in my mind as blurred. It annoys the hell out of my sister when she's trying to talk about switching drag queens we both like, and I can't connect names with faces, and I can't remember what people look like unless they have something unique about them. 

I don't know what to do anymore...

* Me time - It can be difficult to find extra time due to a busy schedule but its extremely essential to take some time off to do something you love so you can feel relaxed. It can be a hot bath, watching Netflix or even just taking a walk. 
* Organising - This is a lesser-known tip however it can help you figure out what is important and what is not. This also saves a lot of time and energy because it can help you write down all the tasks and responsibilities.

I don't really know how to explain this well so i'll try the best I can, sorry for grammar mistakes.

Let's get to the point.

My mental health has been deteriorating since a few months before quarantine, the first signs(If you could call them that) were that I have a sudden interest for more dark subjects. I was exposed to horror movies at a young age, at first I thought they were cool but then I started having nightmares and couldn't sleep. I continued viewing less appropriate material for years after that, it went from normal pornography to guro then to necrophilia, I havn't actually done anything to a dead body out of paranoia of the consequences. I don't want to tell anyone because when my older sister told my mom she self harms mom screamed at her, hit her, called her crazy and sent her to a psychatric ward. I don't want her to do the same to me since my older sister moved out a few months ago.

j0llng,MentalHealthSupport,1601184745.0,"So about a month ago i rewatched The Perks of Being a Wallflower, one of my favorite movies, but this time it stirred up some unwanted feelings. I think i remember when i was about 11 my dad came into my room to ‚Äúsleep‚Äù with me while i was half asleep. Then i remember my eyes bolting open as he slid his hand under my red t shirt and began touching me. i kept on pretending to be asleep but soon it became unbearably uncomfortable, i crossed my arms tightly around my chest to gesture i wanted him to stop but he roughly proceeded and continued to move down. Throughout this entire time we never said a word to each other or even looked at each other. He began dry humping me but of course i didn‚Äôt know what that was back then, but now thinking about it i realized how disgusted i am. After that time two memories came flooding back, i remember when i about 8/9 and would lay next to him on his bed and how he would reach his hand in my shirt and under my training bra. But what if he did something worst when i was super young and i just can‚Äôt remember? i am ashamed to say that it kinda felt good and i kinda like it before i grew up and realized what happened. And when i think back to it i feel aroused and masturbate while i create fantasies and touch my self the way he did which i know is terrible. That night i began to start feeling super anxious and panicky. My heart started to beat very fast with a tingly sensation in my hands and i started crying. I stayed up very late because i could not fall asleep for the life of me, researching trauma and sexual abuse to realize that i had some of the signs. I found out about sex/masturbation at a early age (about 10) and i remember being hyper sexual when i was 5(so many be it started even earlier?). I had regression to bed wetting for a majority of elementary school and a surprisingly small amount of childhood memories. I also learned that i would dissociate bc i remember frequently saying ‚Äúis this even real?‚Äù and feeling super detached. I‚Äôm pretty sure that i did experience all of this but i felt completely fine a few days later. I‚Äôm not sure why i‚Äôm not traumatized as i feel like i should be. Maybe i am but it‚Äôs just repressed? Or maybe it‚Äôs just me seeking attention? (my parents have never been emotionally there for me and never hug or say i love you to each other or us)I definitely don‚Äôt think my expirence was as bad compared to many csa and rape survivors so i don‚Äôt see why i felt like that. I learned to repress a lot of my emotions and never liked feeling vulnerable. i am ashamed and embarrassed that this happened and i couldn‚Äôt even tell my mom if i wanted to. is there something wrong with me? why do i feel okay about it and not traumatized? I don‚Äôt get intense flashbacks but i do remember a few small details and how it felt.

I experienced a stroke, and was diagnosed with two rare brain disorders that I had all of my life but didnt know. I took charge of my health, navigating through health insurance, finding the best doctors, and was successful. For the most part. Although my brain diseases were rare and hard to treat I stayed postive through it all. I have had brain surgery, radiation, hours of physical therapy a d speech therapy. In 2017 I felt pretty good, despite all of my hurdles. My ex left me, I moved into my own apartment, picked up a small part time job to make ends meet ( I am on disability), and began living life. 
In 2018 I began developing a lot of pain. It started in on my back, moved to my joints and everything began spiralling downward. I went to too many doctors to count, chasing a diagnoses and was left without any answers. My symptoms are  forever changing so it is hard to treat something if it changes. Daily I am in constant  pain, severe brain fog, confusion, word finding issues, I have a lot of wierd sensations and numbness all throughout my body, heart palpations, a feeling of a vibrating sensations in the inside of my body, migraines, I wasnt able to use my arm for two weeks due to the severe pain, tremors, muscle loss  ( wasting), and zero strength.

I literally went to the behaviour health center to have a assessment. They set me up with a thearpist and physicists but not for over a month. I do not know if I have the strength inside myself to fight Lyme Disease on top of my struggles fighting my rare brain disorders. Which is progressive.

ido08i,MentalHealthSupport,1597975740.0,"Ever since I can remember, my dad has always been a yeller. But i was little then, and I just thought that because he used to be in the military, and was a cop (at the time), that it is probably because of that. Now that I'm a little older (15) I can realize stuff now, and I feel like I'm being mentally abused by him.

I want to say first off that I'm not saying he is a bad father. He has worked his ass off to provide for our family. I live in a good house, I go to a catholic school, I eat good. I know, what is this kid complaining about, he has a privilege that most don't, he shouldn't be complaining. But here is the thing, I would rather live in a shitty home, go to a public school, and have nothing, if he wasn't the way he was. If he wasn't how he is now, and how he treats me, I would rather have nothing, because I would be happy that he shows me the amount of affection I see other kids get. If I were to tell him that, he would tell me the list would go on and on about the things he has done for me, but I dont care about the money that he spent on me. That isnt love.

I have a few reasons on why I think what I do

1. He is always yelling or getting mad at everything everyone does in the house: He yells if people have to ask him to repeat something more than once(When he constantly does that.) He will yell at you and be mad at you if you forget something(When that is something he is constantly doing.) 
2. He is always suspicious and thinks that we are all lying to him: It makes me feel like I'm never trusted.
3. He brings me down and it makes me change the way I am: He has called me a ""fag"" for the way I used to part my hair, so I started to change the way I was doing my hair, (for my entire life up to when i was 12 when he called me that) He has made fun of the way my jaw is shaped, and I feel like I can never have a good picture now, because it is all I see, and I want to change it so he doesn't think that way
4. I am always the one who is wrong in everything because, ""he is older than me"": I was told by him, ""Whether you like it or not, your always gonna lose."" And it makes me feel like everything is my fault. I am always apologizing for everything, even with things that I shouldn't apologize for. My girlfriend tells me that I say sorry too often.
5. He lies to make himself right in situations: Just the other day, I made myself food, and I didnt know he wanted anything. I told him, ""I can go back upstairs and make you something, because I didnt know you wanted anything."" But he wouldnt let me. He ends up waking up my mother, who is asleep, and asks her to make him food, because I refused to make him any. And I cant say anything because I know, ""I'm always going to lose.""

I feel like I have so much anxiety for no reason. I woke up having an anxiety attack in the middle of the night one time after he yelled at me that for something. But I cant say anything because, ""I'm always going to lose."" He tells me I have anxiety for reason, and that I have nothing to have anxiety about. But what he doesnt understand is that I have anxiety because I am always worried that Im going to get yelled for everything.

I tell my mom how I feel, and all she can tell me is, ""Forget about the things he's done."" But she doesnt understand that it is hard to, because ive experience it my entire life. I cant just, forget about the past and POOF its gone. But she doesnt understand thats not how it works.

I cant have a conversation with him about it because, ""I'm always going to lose""

My mom tells me that I just have to deal with it until I move out. But I dont know when that will be, and i cant be living in an environment where I am always wrong, I cant be trusted, and that I cant do anything about because, ""Im always gonna lose."" She tells me that I cant talk to a therapist, or a priest about it, until I move out, because he isnt gonna let me talk about the shit he has done, to someone else. But I NEED SOMEONE NOW,not in 10 years, I need someone to talk about how I feel now. So I feel like this is a good place to get some advice. I just hope that my dad doesnt see this, because I'm gonna feel like the worst person in the world",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthSupport/comments/ido08i/i_feel_like_im_being_mentally_abused_by_my_father/,I feel like I'm being mentally abused by my father,,9,1,1.0

i8flkv,MentalHealthSupport,1597245562.0,"A little back ground,

I was diagnosed with ADHD when I was very young and spent most of my childhood medicated for that and in some form of special ed. This made me feel odd and I was very aware even as young as 8 that most kids were not taking these extra classes. Other kids noticed too, which led to some minor bullying. I dont wanna go too deep here, but I also want to mention that I faced some physical/emotional abuse in middle school and then again in highschool. The blows to my self esteem and the abuse together have made it basically impossible to maintain a healthy relationship, I spent the majority of my 20s alone, and I am now 30 and most of my friends are getting married and this again, makes me feel like shit because it all seems so unattainable to me. Recently I began having panic attacks, so I sought out my old therapist after having not really seeking for years. She started me on Ativan to get me over the hump. This helped with the anxiety but the next thing to figure out was the depression. So, for about 1.5 weeks now I have been taking Lexipro. Frankly, I dont feel any less depressed. I feel flat. Numb. Tired. Most thing I love taste like ash to me, and yet I am still over eating garbage food. I also have a lot of pervasive thoughts of death and suicide. I don‚Äôt PLAN on killing myself, I just want to be clear about that. But I wanted to hear from someone out there that might have some experience with these medications. Is this normal?

I've gone to a therapist before, but for the wrong reasons, back when I was 11 my parents decided to enroll me into therapy due to my parents going through a divorce around the time I kind of knew what was happening and also not knowing at the same time. I knew that it wasn't my fault but I felt I was part of the problem, also had a baby sister to look after.

I don't want to put my entire life story out on the internet but to give you strangers a shortened version.

‚Ä¢ (10-11) Went through a divorce without knowing what was really happening and why at a young age.

‚Ä¢ (birth-17) Never had a consistant and good father figure growing up, as well as I was basically starved for attention from my own father which had more interest in partying and doing drugs when I needed him.

‚Ä¢ (13-17) Humiliated yelled at daily, and almost close to getting physical at a few points by my step father at the time. He would make up things to bitch at me for and his rants would last on average an hour and a half.

‚Ä¢ (17-23/current day) And was basically forced to mature at a younger age than the average male to look after my mom and baby sister, as well as to this day doing my best to be a good role model and a father figure to her.

‚Ä¢ Briefly covering my past relationships; every girlfriend I've had has cheated on me on multiple occasions other than my most recent partner.

With everything going on now a days has me very worried about the future in general and not to mention my family. I've been so focused on the well being of my family that I guess I didn't make time for my mental health, kept getting bottled up and here we are. No motivation to stay healthy, lazy, nihilistic, heavily depressed on the daily that its starting to seep into my work life. I know I need to go to therapy but I don't have the money for it, and I don't think my insurance covers therapy.

It's getting worse because I've recently had thoughts on starting back up with self harm.. I of course shut that out immediately, I use to cut and burn myself in my teens when my depression was at a all time high.

ggft0f,MentalHealthSupport,1589032479.0,"\*fearful lol

Hi.

I hope this is the right subbreddit for this. This will be a long post. I've been diagnosed with anxiety and depression 2 years ago, but I've been struggling with them for at least 10 years. My health care is stationed at a students' clinic so I don't have many options on therapists and psychiatrists. I haven't felt as if they understand my emotional trauma. They usually prescribe your anxiety to your studies...which isn't what I wanted to work on on my sessions. My therapist completely ignored my problems and concerns.

Well, as the title says, I'm suffering with anxious/fearful attachment. It definitely stems from the relationship with my family, but mostly my mother. She was a really emotionally distant parent. Since a young age, I didn't have a bond with her. Her mental health hasn't been in a good state throughout half of my childhood. It got worse when I entered puberty, which definitely impacted on my development as a person. She has always been critical, dismissive, cold, uninterested. Nothing I ever did was good enough. I never got praises, just scolding, even though I was a pretty good kid. All of her responses were passive-aggressive. **I never got affection** (hugs, getting told ""I love you""). Even though she was uninterested, she tried to be very controlling and never trusted me, even though I never did anything in order not to have trust. As a kid, I did have to hide a lot of things from my parents. But they were never bad things. It was usually about where I was and who I've been with, Deep down I knew I never did anything wrong, but their reactions to normal things in life were always bad. I never did bad stuff behind their back, they were just very distrustful of others. Over time, I stopped lying about that kind of stuff.  But thankfully I worked through that so she doesn't rule over my life. My parents weren't strict, they're a very weird mix of strict and not caring at all. My friends say it's weird, but I explain my relationship with them as if we are roommates. I just got autonomy as I got older. My dad is okay. I didn't get emotional abuse from him, but he's just the type of guy that doesn't discuss emotions. I've always had a better bond with him, but I never had a parent with whom I could work on my emotions with. I only started working on my emotions at the age of 17, even though I've been struggling for at least 6 years prior to that. My parents always had the wrong approach to my depression. Because of my mothers' passive aggressive attitude and dismissiveness, I opted out to not sharing anything at all. I know they know something was off, but our relationship isn't much different today. As I matured, I tried to talk to them a few times but it was hopeless. They dismiss my feelings. **They're just those kind of people**. So our relationship will stay like this.

My mother has gotten back into therapy last year, after 12 years of not going. I'm glad for her, she's been in a better state than ever throughout my childhood. But I can't ignore the fact that her behaviour created a lot of trauma. Reading about holistic psychology has helped me a lot. My past romantic relationships have helped me. But I'm still struggling to control my instincts when something triggers my anxiety.

I am in a relationship at the moment and it's still fresh. I've reacted badly when triggered with some stuff. e.g. I feel as if I'm a burden and I just close off and not reply to texts to hours. I want to communicate my feelings but I always have a fear that I'm a burden. My self worth is really low. I don't feel as if my feelings are valid.

I think that my state is worse when it comes to friendships. I've lost quite a few close friends throughout the years. Some were just natural, people change and go their own ways. But some just ended for no reason and with no explainations. I always had a problem with closeness and intimacy. I got better through time. I have 3 best friends, and a few close friends. But I still think that I lack closeness. I open up when I can, I share things...I'm very different from my past. I don't overshare things. But I always have a feeling that the person I'm talking with isn't feeling a close bond with me. I got good at meeting new people, but it's gotten bad the past year. People just don't seem interested in what I have to say. I wouldn't call myself a cold person, but people just don't seem to see a friend in me, even though I'm friendly. To make it worse, I was in a relationship with a guy with an avoidant personality, which made my anxiety from the past worse. What really threw me off track was his confessions that none of his friends liked me. His friends weren't the most mature people so I didn't hit it off with some of them, but I wouldn't say anything negative abou them. I either like them or I'm neutral. But even the ones I thought I hit it off with, turned out not liking me. He even told me what some of them individually thought about me. He told me that I should just maybe change my approach into making friends. And that really had an impact on my confidence. I don't know what I did wrong, as I've been nothing but friendly with new people. I don't have the need to impress new people. I'm just acting like myself. Since then, I've had a fear of meeting new people because I think they won't like me.

My past romantic relationships also ended with my exes breaking up. One of the reasons were them getting bored of the relationship, whereas, I wasn't on the same page..I'm glad they ended now, I gained experience, I learned stuff. But I never felt bored or fed up. Which also impacted on my self-worth and fear of being inadequate.

Well to sum it up. I don't know how to work on my self worth. It's nice to hear from someone that they appreciate you. But I don't know how reassurance can help me when I don't feel that way about myself. I will always have a negative and critical subconscious about myself. I want to have my own self worth. But nothing in my life makes me feel the opposite way. I don't know how to reassure myself. I can tell myself that it's going to be okay and stuff aren't as bad as I perceive them, but I'm having a hard time believing it.

My instant reactions to my triggers are to recluse and hate myself. I don't want to burden people with my problems. Nobody even asks me how I am except my boyfriend, when he notices that I've been away. I'd say 2 of my close friends are there to listen, I stay in touch with the others sporadically. But if it weren't for them, none of my friends I consider good friends would consider checking up on me, asking me to hang out etc...and that's been proven through time. I try to maintain those friendships but they don't seem to feel the need to do the same. When I notice that they don't, I back off. Then I end up not seeing them for a year.",https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthSupport/comments/ggft0f/how_to_i_22f_deal_with_anxiousdearful_attachment/,How to I (22F) deal with anxious/dearful attachment,,9,3,1.0
gafxey,MentalHealthSupport,1588188719.0,"tldr: these thoughts seem impossible to control because they are guaranteed or likely to happen. at least if it were something unrealistic i could reason my way out of it. but instead ive been having a 2+ year long existential crisis full of very real possibilities. avoiding the news abt climate change/politics helps and so does zoloft, but those are just bandaid solutions in the grand scheme of things. also i tried to give some context abt my family without it getting too long but as you can see, i failed. sorry this is so long and disorganized, ultimately the tldr is all you need.

moving out has helped with the family stuff in that im separated from any immediate chaos but i still feel that i have a huge responsibility to do anything i can to help \[be it for advice, a shoulder to cry on, etc\]. my husband says i dont owe them anything and i cant put the weight of their problems on myself, but its my family, its our problems. this isnt him saying to cut them off ofc, but that i shouldnt feel so guilty about something i cant control. all i ever wanted, esp since for the most part i didnt grow up with extended family nearby, is for all of us to stay connected for the sake of ourselves and any kids we might have. it might be important to know that we started dating when i was at rock bottom and after an incident with my mom i just spilled my guts and told him everything, so he has a skewed perception of my parents--in my opinion--because he has no context and first knew them at their worst. he would never ask me to cut off contact and he does love my family; ultimately my involvement with my family is up to me, he just worries. and tbh that bothers me bc i feel like he just doesnt get it. family dynamic is waaaaay different when most members in it have some kind of mental/emotional/developmental/etc disability, let alone multiple, and when you try to get help for your kids youre ignored and called a helicopter parent, so you do your best with whatever skills you have, not realizing that youre trying to put a square peg in a round hole, and pushing it with all your strength just damages the peg. my husband and his family are all neurotypical, though he has some understanding since he works in the kitchen at a psych hospital. ultimately i think hes clinging to the story i told him when i was at absolute rock bottom, and now that im better and made my peace and know my parents' perspective \[they were scared for my wellbeing and meanwhile my brother started a new expensive special ed school and my sister was suicidal, they couldnt handle everything at once effectively\], ive tried recontextualizing things but he seems to think im just making excuses and now that im better ive forgotten just how bad things were. which is kind of fair given that my mom once trashed my room and broke some stuff, but if was actually abuse then why are my relationships with my family so much healthier now, hm? checkmate atheists

suffice it to say, i hate these thoughts because these are things that realistically could/will \[in the case of death\] happen. my parents raised five kids, four of whom still live at home \[i got married but if not for that id still be at home\], because of college and/or for financial stability. but now, theyre just burnt out and im pretty sure theyre depressed. my dad doesnt talk about it but my mom does and she feels like a terrible mother. all she wanted was to raise a family and now two out of five kids hate her and dont show any signs of changing \[my older sister especially\].

i felt the same way tbh but after a lot of soul-searching and work on my both my and my moms parts, ive made my peace with it and am rebuilding bridges with her and my siblings. growing up--i wouldnt say we were abused per se, but the way we were mostly raised wasnt... what we needed? we all had undiagnosed invisible disabilities, and up until the past few years they raised us all from an old-fashioned, neurotypical lens. it wasnt bc theyre bad ppl, they just didnt know better. and it wasnt for lack of trying; i was born premature and my mom knew something was up but whenever she brought it up to doctors etc looking for answers, she gained a reputation as a helicopter parent. it wasnt until i was 19 that we really learned anything about autism and how to navigate it, and thats bc my younger brother was diagnosed and she read/did everything she could to help. but the rest of us still had undiagnosed disabilities so we didnt get the same... help? at least not for a while; eventually she started applying her new skills with all of us and things have improved tremendously.

my mom confides in me about the situation at home and ive tried a couple times explain where my sisters are coming from since i felt more or less the same way at one point. but when i start talking about how there is some truth to it, she deflects and says how 'we all need to change our behavior, nobodys perfect, etc.' i always tread lightly when mentioning \[more like implying\] that there are things my parents need to own up to but then its always 'what about them tho? were not divorced, alcoholic, etc, why would they hate us? weve sacrificed so much to give you guys a good life \[which is true\], how can they be so toxic?' what surprised me is it was only in our last conversation that she used the word 'toxic,' which ive long believed is true. i guess it like, confirmed my belief and it hurt.

esp my older sister, i think theres still a chance for my younger sister and that moving away for college will be good for her, but honestly i think once my older sister moves out--if ever tbh bc of mental health shit and financial issues and assuming my parents dont eventually kick her out for their own mental health--i think she would just ghost us. maybe shed keep in touch w me bc we have similar values/interests but then again its hard to know if she values me as much as i do her. when we do hang out, we have a genuinely great time but when were apart i feel weird making first contact, since shell just ignore you if she feels like it \[at least at home, shes literally just walked out of a conversation in the middle of it.\]

~~is this what the kids call trauma‚Ñ¢~~

thats enough of that but if anyone has questions, ill gladly answer them.

moving on, the death thoughts are--well, about death. it first started in january 2018 after i got into a car crash \[nobody was hurt but our car was totaled\]. i couldnt bring myself to drive for three months although im better \[and more careful\] now, and tbh i love driving, its very relaxing but im kind of jumpy. and then with climate change and articles the world will be irreversibly damaged in roughly 12 years, and goodness knows the rich capitalists arent gonna do anything that doesnt profit them, despite being richer than god and having more money than they could ever hope to spend. jeff bezos could end world hunger for 12 years and still live comfortably. and then if u tell \[some of\] the very ppl that are directly harmed by this system 'i think we should be treated better actually' they call you a #socialist and act like youve just told jesus go fuck himself.

I know this is so rambly I'm sorry I just, i dont really know how this works, i dont know how to talk about my feelings because i dont understand why I'm so incredibly sad and I just dont feel like I can talk to any of my friends because I know they all struggle with depression at least worse than I did before this pandemic and I dont want to make things worse.
I just I dont know how to get a routine back after this because I think that's what I relied on, was being out doing things and feeling like I had a purpose.

So I found out a couple days ago that the men that used to babysit me and my four sisters would molest us. This was confirmed separately by three out of four because I was only four when he went to prison for production and possession of meth. I recently had a pap done and the doctor talked to me about the scar tissue in my vagina because sex has always been painful for me.

I'm still kind of in denial and I keep thinking ""at least I dont remember it"" but like also not knowing feels kinda terrifying. Like what did he do to me, did this happen?

dt7uss,MentalHealthSupport,1573176062.0,"To preface this, I‚Äôm 17f and this man is maybe in his 60s? We‚Äôll call him John. Now this man is mentally disabled although he hasn't always been. From my understanding when he was in his 20s he was in a car accident that made him mentally disabled and believe he was still in his 20s so he‚Äôs always creeping around younger girls but his brother yells at him for it sometimes.

John goes to the same church as me and he goes with his mother, sister, and brother

When me and my family moved to this town and to this church I got warned by multiple people to keep an eye out for John because he‚Äôs been known to just creepily stare at and follow around the young girls in the church (all around 15-18) and my father was also told all of this and made it clear that he would keep an eye out for him. Now initially when we first started going to the church my mom would call him over and try talking to him while I was standing behind her in our row of seats not making eye contact. She would always make me feel bad for not talking to him because he‚Äôs special needs and we have a couple people in our family who are, so my mom always tries so hard to be friendly and nice to those who are. The entire time my mom would talk to him he would just be staring at me but she wouldn‚Äôt notice. And then from the beginning of church where we would socialize before it started he would just be staring at me and my friends talking and after he would do the same too. It was just this creepy dead eyed stare.

Now eventually my mom realized that what I was saying is right and that John is creepily staring at me so she tried to look out for me more. Whenever he tries to just stand near me or follow me she tries to be a human barrier. One time when my mom noticed he was approaching she pulled me to the back to go in the bathrooms and he followed us all the way back there and waited in the lobby for us to leave the bathroom, and then followed us back into the auditorium where my mom sat me in our seats and he eventually went back to his (thankfully far away from mine). My mom also went grocery shopping one day to the place where apparently he worked and he came up to her and just kept asking questions about me and when he asked how old I was and my mom answered him saying that I‚Äôm 17 he seemed angry so my mom ended the conversation and left. Since then my mother has gotten my father and my older brother to attempt to body guard me while we‚Äôre at church but they just honestly don‚Äôt pay attention and don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a big deal and they don‚Äôt take it seriously.

Now this has been happening over a period of 4-5 months, and he‚Äôs never actually talked to me or tried to say anything to me except for the first time my parents made me look at him and tell him my name (even though I was extremely uncomfortable and have mentioned to them before I never want to talk to him) but this past Wednesday as we were leaving our church John just in the creepiest way possible said ‚Äúbye unusual_breadstick‚Äù and I wanted in that moment to actually die. And as soon as we (me my brother and my father) got into the parking lot my dad started making fun of me for it and started joking about how I‚Äôm going to marry him one day.

Now I know nothing truly serious has happened but I just don‚Äôt want to risk it ever having to actually be serious for me to get the help I need with him. It‚Äôs greatly disturbing me and my family just make jokes about me and him being together in the future even though I‚Äôve told them before now I wasn‚Äôt okay with it.

Basically I just want an outsiders clear view on this to tell me if I‚Äôm being dramatic or not.

I‚Äôm 19 now and I drank because a boy who ‚Äúloved‚Äù me for 3 years almost raped me. He pulled down my robe and groped my breasts and I was frozen. Waiting for him to ask for consent but he didn‚Äôt and I pushed him off and ran to the bathroom with my phone crying.

I got drunk the next day and told him to replay the previous day but ask for consent because I can‚Äôt sleep, I can‚Äôt function knowing I was almost rape. So I begged him to replace it into a good memory and whatever it was, he asked for consent this time. 

After that he would drive me to quiet areas at night and say he was horny and just stare at me. I thought he only wanted to kiss because I was a virgin and I had no sexual experience. He would come on top of me and just take what he wanted like I was an object. Gradually he became possessive and threw his laptop on me when a friend called him a cuck, Hes screamed at me for giving him blue balls.

c9fy38,MentalHealthSupport,1562333241.0,"Disclaimer: it‚Äôs going to be a long post, please bear with me.
In summation: my best friend has been struggling with depression and suicidal thoughts her whole life and yesterday she sent me some very worrying messages and I don‚Äôt know how to help with her moving countries in two months. Any advice appreciated. 

I‚Äôm 20 years old, female, I‚Äôm in my second year of university and I met Sophia in my first year, when we immediately clicked. On our first meeting Sophie confided in me a lot of the trauma she was dealing with, I knew this was a woman in pain, she didn‚Äôt have any close friends and most of the people she‚Äôd met had used her naturally trusting nature against her. I‚Äôve always felt very protective of her, she came to this country from abroad and was not very confident in her English, finding it difficult to make friends and distinguishing between people who had her best interests at heart and those who were just using her. Her whole life she‚Äôd struggled with depression, coming from a very poor country there was no option of therapy or counselling, very little understanding or tolerance and with her parents working full time she never had anybody to talk to. Moving to the UK to study meant that her mother had to leave her father and come to the UK also to provide enough money for her to live here. She carried a lot of guilt about that, the pressure of being an only child meant that they‚Äôd placed all of their hopes and aspirations on her so any time she didn‚Äôt achieve perfect grades or work enough hours she would berate herself and call herself ungrateful, unappreciative and unworthy. She has a very deep rooted problem with her self-worth, she constantly compares her pain and suffering to that of people who have it worse than her. She is unable to accept that she is allowed to hurt and cry without feeling guilty about it because people have it worse, but when I tell her this she brushes it off. 

For a long time Sophia was improving herself, taking active steps to better her mental health. She quit smoking, started going to the gym, and stopped drinking. As well as these lifestyle changes she also stopped calling herself fat, she began confiding in me more, speaking more openly about her problems and just overall working harder to achieve a sense of happiness. But recently her mental health took a turn for the worst, exam season and then a very tough betrayal from a close friend / romantic interest really knocked her down. Five days ago she showed up at my door shaking, ten minutes into the conversation she began sobbing and had a full scale emotional breakdown, she pulled a bottle of wine and a full packet of cigarettes out of her bag and began smoking and drinking heavily until she passed out. She‚Äôs suffered from depressive episodes like this before and I‚Äôve always managed to help see her through them, but this time it‚Äôs different. 

Last night she sent me some extremely worrying messages. Below I‚Äôve copied and pasted snippets of what she said without my replies just to save some reading time. 

[start]
I hope you know that I would really do anything for you / And I am a disgusting human being unworthy of you but / And this is stupid to say but / Even if I failed you / I really love you and I would really do everything for you.

I failed you and god
Cause god gave me you
I know that was god
That‚Äôs why I still pray sometimes
And when I disrespect you and us
I disrespect god
Who did me so good
I feel like I would have died endless times without you these years
And I don‚Äôt deserve this good thing
Because I don‚Äôt know what to do with it
You don‚Äôt want and need someone like me I‚Äôm feeling ashamed to say this but it‚Äôs true

I can‚Äôt 
Like I can‚Äôt handle this
We need to talk
-I‚Äôm coming back right now
No I can‚Äôt see you 
Not now
-(we arrange a date)
I‚Äôll see you then
You‚Äôll understand soon 
And you‚Äôll know.
I love you either way

[end]

With the year over, I‚Äôve gone back home to be with my family and she‚Äôs stayed in university on her own to work and save money. I‚Äôm going to visit her in ten days but I‚Äôm so anxious I feel like I should go sooner, but I don‚Äôt have the money for the train ticket. Also she said she can‚Äôt see me now and then refused to offer further explanation why. Recently, she told me she was struggling with her faith, she couldn‚Äôt believe in God anymore and that made her sick with herself. For her birthday I bought her a really big candle because I know she loves them and they have both religious and sentimental value to her, she told me afterwards that in her religion when you pray, you‚Äôre supposed to light a candle. But with her lack of faith she hadn‚Äôt bought one, but because she had one she‚Äôd started praying again. So at least there‚Äôs that. 

When she came to me that day she kept on saying over and over again about how she didn‚Äôt deserve me as a friend and that she felt like she‚Äôd failed me, in the texts too she said that over and over again how she‚Äôd let me down and disappointed me. No matter how many times I assured her that wasn‚Äôt the case, she‚Äôd brush it off. I know she‚Äôs always grappled with feelings of inferiority but I didn‚Äôt realise that this was the case with our friendship, I know now that she looks up to me and she‚Äôs told me on multiple occasions that I make her want to be a better person. But I know that I‚Äôm also putting pressure on her to be a version of herself that I‚Äôm just not sure she‚Äôs ready to be yet, I don‚Äôt want to pressure her like her parents do. I want to be a friend who she can turn to, I always tell her to leave the people who hurt her in the past and get frustrated when she gives them so many chances when they‚Äôre totally undeserving of her forgiveness and generosity. She constantly lends money to men after they‚Äôve used her for sex, believes their lies and promises, lets girls make her feel inferior due to her lack of money and allows people to mock her English and accent. God, it breaks my heart. I know I can come off a bit aggressive when I tell her to stop accepting this behaviour but it frustrates me so much! I really need some advice on how I can help her or adjust my behaviour to make myself more approachable, I feel like if I hadn‚Äôt told her so many times to just leave the boys alone then she wouldn‚Äôt feel like she‚Äôd disappointed me by staying with them. And I know that makes it hard for her to ask me for help because she feels like she‚Äôs pissing me off (she is, but I‚Äôd still rather be there to help than have her deal with it alone). 

I‚Äôm really scared about what might happen because in two months she leaves the country to go back home and start planning for her next year, where she‚Äôll be living in another country. I don‚Äôt doubt that she‚Äôll do amazing studying abroad next year but she has so little faith in herself, she knows she‚Äôs strong enough to get through it but I don‚Äôt want her to feel like she‚Äôs just barely keeping her head above water for the rest of her university education. She‚Äôs told me on many occasions that the ‚Äúonly reason‚Äù she doesn‚Äôt kill herself is because she doesn‚Äôt want to let her parents down, that they‚Äôve sacrificed so much that she couldn‚Äôt be so selfish as to throw it all away. I know that she feels like a burden to everybody in her life, she even feels like I‚Äôm doing her a favour when we hang out, she can‚Äôt fathom that I actually want to spend time with her. It breaks my heart, I don‚Äôt know how to communicate with her when she‚Äôs so far reserved within herself that she cannot believe the truth of what I‚Äôm telling her. After two years she‚Äôs finally admitted that she‚Äôs got depression and for the first time when I suggested therapy she acceded that it was something she ought to do, but I know that there‚Äôs three months until she‚Äôll be attending university and can even think of applying for counselling because there is no option for that in her home country. 

Please, any advice in ways I can communicate with her, help her, adapt my behaviour, advice I can give her, anything, would be so appreciated. I‚Äôve tried everything but I feel so heavy handed when I try anything new, like I‚Äôm really not helping her at all.

aancud,MentalHealthSupport,1546106699.0,"My daughter suffers from debilitating anxiety and depression. For years I've been trying to find a good doctor psychiatrist to help her thought I finally found one last year. Psychiatrist gave her fluoxetine and bupropion and it lasted for about a month and then my daughter start feeling awful again.

When they were driving in the car and although crying is a daily occurrence the kind that she was doing that day was very different. I was on the highway I pulled over to the breakdown Lane and she told me that she just couldn't handle the pain anymore she just could not do it anymore.  

I brought her to the ER a psychiatrist came down so the two medications she was taking were totally wrong. He said she should be on fluoxetine only and put her on 10mg.

I spent the next two months trying to find her a doctor, another doctor found one that's an hour and a half away I have to take nearly an entire day off from work to bring her but I'm happy to do it.  Who needs to live in a house anyway?

I found a new doctor was not covered by my insurance but will take an adolescent so I dish out $350 every time I see her for a half an hour. Again I'm fine with paying that. Who needs electricity anyway?

The new doctor puts her on escitalopram.  Been about 2 months 10 mg not much change in my daughter. 

So here I am. A daughter who needs me 24/7, a son who needs me and I don't pay the attention to him that he deserves. House to take care of bills to pay and I am failing at it all.

I don't think people understand the pressures of dealing with a child with mental health. Everyone thinks you can just take a pill and you're better but it is not that way. Not at all. The emotional and financial strain is like that of someone who's dealing with cancer or some other debilitating disease.

And I can't find one bit of help anywhere.

11opc9y,MentalHealthSupport,1678554637.0,"As a doctor, here are some general tips for maintaining good mental health:
1. Get Enough Sleep: Lack of sleep can contribute to mood swings, anxiety, depression, and other mental health issues. Aim for at least 7-8 hours of sleep per night.
2. Exercise Regularly: Exercise releases endorphins, which are natural mood boosters. It can also help reduce stress and anxiety. Aim for at least 30 minutes of exercise most days of the week.
3. Eat a Balanced Diet: A healthy diet can help improve your mood and energy levels. Aim for a diet that includes plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins.
4. Manage Stress: Stress can have a negative impact on mental health. Find healthy ways to manage stress, such as exercise, relaxation techniques, or talking to a friend or therapist.
5. Stay Connected: Social support is important for mental health. Make time for friends and family, or join a social group or club.
6. Practice Mindfulness: Mindfulness techniques, such as meditation or deep breathing, can help reduce stress and improve mental clarity.
7. Seek Professional Help: If you are struggling with your mental health, don't hesitate to seek professional help. A therapist or psychiatrist can provide support and guidance.

But ""friends"", I've reached out to them all the time but I never get anything back and this makes my depression worse.

Make sure you're taking care of yourself, both physically and mentally. Get enough sleep, eat well, exercise, and make time for things that make you happy. Consider talking to a therapist or counselor, who can provide you with the support and guidance you need to improve your mental health.

Remember that healing takes time, be patient and compassionate with yourself. You are worthy of healing and happiness. Don't be afraid to reach out for help and support. You are not alone and you are not defined by your mental health challenges, Keep fighting and Believe in yourself.

yk2sn9,MentalHealthSupport,1667388909.0,"Hello, 

I hope this message is acceptable on this forum. I wanted to share a story of my mental health journey to encourage those who may be going through a rough time, that there can be an end to suffering and there is definitely light at the end of the dark tunnel. 

A few years ago, I developed a neurological disorder called conversion syndrome. The bizarre thing about conversion syndrome is that doctors cannot pin point the trigger or cause and in most cases have a very difficult time picking it up. In my case it took months, several hospital and neurologist visits and many doctors. 

Anyway, I just woke up with it one day and it was very similar to experiencing a stroke. I lost my speech and my motor functioning, out of the blue. It was bizarre and the scariest thing that's ever happened to me. It was terrifying cos my presentation was like that of a stroke patient even though I never lost consciousness and I was fully compus mentus inside, on the outside I couldn't move or speak. The only way I could express myself was by writing letters, which I did prodigiously and it became clearer to the people around me that I was still there inside. I became so depressed because I am usually a very active and healthy person (thankfully I am back to that!) and I didn't know if I was ever going to come out of the freeze state. The thought of not moving properly or speaking properly again terrified me. At some points I thought I was dying. All I could do was sleep, watch tv and bath. 

But eventually this crisis state became a blessing. It literally forced me into a conscious space where all I could focus on was one moment at a time. My brain was too stressed to think about anything else. At first the moment itself was very scary because I wanted it to be so different, but eventually I relaxed into it and I realized that the only way I was gonna come out of it was one moment at a time. I decided to use my mental energy to imagine myself getting better and healthy again. If I thought about anything else or worried to much, my brain could not handle it and I started tremors. The only thing that helped me relax was long epsom salt baths and thinking of health and wellness. My brain liked those thoughts :) And it worked!

Eventually I came right with the help of physiotherapy and visualization, I made a full recovery after a few months. It was a blessing because it led me to seek help for depression and emotional related maladies and now I am in the healthiest, best, most positive place I have ever been in my life! The living moment by moment state of consciousness has stayed with me ever since. I practice mindfulness meditation and visualization techniques every day, and generally live a healthy, mindful, active life of hiking and being out in nature and playing sport and swimming. I self-regulate my emotions and am emotionally, physically, mentally and spiritally healthy. I am so grateful for the experience of health and wellness because I know it's opposite very well. All I really want in life is to stay in the state of good health and wellness, and that is my focus.

I just wanted to share this post for anyone going through depression, anxiety or nervous breakdown, there is definitely hope. All you need do is believe that you can and will get well and that will start the process in your body. Your thoughts impact your physical and mental health, so think positive even if only for a few minutes a day and it will make difference! You may need to surrender and accept some help along the way, but that is more than okay when you are in a vulnerable state. Do some form of self care, even it is only a bath or shower, make it a cleansing ritual. Try and be grateful for something, start with the people who care for you and are invested in your health and wellness.

I hope this post can help in some way.

w4xgt9,MentalHealthSupport,1658452679.0,"
My instagram has always been cantered around my experiences and my daily life while dealing with mental health and depression. I upload content relating to my art but also share how I deal with each day and how my mental health/addiction affects me, positively and negatively. I like to show the bad stuff as well as the good and also show that the way we react to things like our mental health and addiction is nothing to be ashamed of or embarrassed about and that the things we do and go through are normal.

Also, because I am poor/lower class, I also can‚Äôt afford expensive makeup, I usually buy my makeup cheap or get it through donations.

I was wondering if it would interest you to firstly follow how an amateur does their makeup? Watching professionals do they‚Äôre makeup can be quite intimidating and can knock your confidence a bit and I find it‚Äôs nice to watch people who are on your level, who are relatable who can also show you that you can still do makeup to look good even if you are a beginner and it‚Äôs also interesting to follow peoples journeys as they learn and improve and these were my intentions for my content that I want to start sharing and would love people to join me on my journey

Secondly, I would like to review, show and recommend the cheaper brands and products that I use and can afford and also show that you can achieve good looks with cheap brands, I hope this would be relatable to people in my position and also help inspire and guide people like me that they can achieve great cosmetic look and how to do so with cheaper brands and that you don‚Äôt need expensive stuff to look good.


I started all of this with the intention to inspire and build confidence in people who are like me. Social media pushes on us that we have to be attractive, good at makeup, have good hair and skin, have perfect, happy lives, that we have to look after our bodies going to the gym everyday for example, that is we should have lots of friends, a successful life and it pushes on us to feel ashamed if we don't have friends and/or family, to feel like a failure if we don't have a good career or a career at all, to be unhappy with our lives if we don't do much or don't go out, that we are disgusting if we don't shower for a week or lazy if we don't get out of bed and I wanted to use my instagram to help others realise that all this stuff is crap and they're shitty expectations put on us.

I wanted to show people that it's okay to spend a week in bed if we feel depressed, it's okay to neglect our hygiene every once in a while if our mood feels so low, it's okay to have fun and enjoy our own company and that you don't need friends to enjoy life, you don't need friends to go out for meals, go to the cinemas, go shopping, you don't need a perfect career or a career at all to show that you have achieved something or to show that you have purpose, motivation and that you can still be an intelligent, inspiring, important, motivated person even if you stay at home and don't work, i wanted to show that you can be an addict and still be a kind, loyal, honest, worthy person, you can be an addict and still look good, you can be an addict and still have close relationships, i wanted to highlight that there are some people in this life that are sober/clean and they can be just as or even more dishonest, unfaithful, disloyal, nasty, untrustworthy than someone who is using. I wanted to show that on some days we don't feel like making ourselves look nice, or eating, or talking to anyone... 

People with mental health and addiction have bad stigmas and stereotypes against them and my intention and goal was to show that those things don't matter, they don't make a person, what matters is your heart and what's inside, like I said, there are some people who don't have mental health or addictions that are worse people than someone that does have all that stuff. I also wanted to reassure others that the way we react to things in life is normal and not to be ashamed, not to worry about what others think and only worry about ourselves, because when we stop worrying about others and just focus on ourselves it's easier to recover, when we are depressed for example, sometimes we need to sleep in bed for a week, we need to be lazy, we need to cut ourselves off from the outside world so that we can recover, when we worry about judgement and push ourselves to get out of bed when we don't feel like it, we can't recover and heal properly, if we push ourselves to go to work we might make our damage worse... if you had flu or a broken leg, you wouldn't push yourself to get out of bed and do things, go to work, socialise etc because you wouldn't be able to get better and mental health/addiction is the exact same

I just want to help people and help them realise they're not alone or the odd one out, I also hope to bring awareness to others.

I don't need thousands of followers, that's not my goal, my goal is to reach the people that need the help, inspiration, acceptance, encouragement as that's my main goal in this.

I have never felt the need to promote my social media and gain a larger following and isn't the purpose of my post, rather I really want to help others and try and change and/or improve peoples lives and give someone a friend and someone to relate to and I am just trying to offer my help on a larger scale in case there is someone out there that really needs it. Im not sure if I can advertise my instagram account in this post or comments but if you are interested in joining me on my path and need some encouragement and reassurance, please reach out and let me know and I'll share with you the place to go

urfml3,MentalHealthSupport,1652766487.0,"Hi, everyone! I guess the best place to start is the beginning. So, a bit of a backstory - I just got out of a messy marriage and come to find out, well, I was basically a meal ticket out of her bad financial situation. Before we got married, she failed to tell me that she was $100K in debt. We've been separated for almost two years, no kids, and I had to move closer to family because I lost everything. I left my marriage broken both financially, mentally, and emotionally. It gets better: before I got married, I was in a relationship with a woman that pretty was the most TOXIC relationship I've ever been in: gaslighting, mental and physical abuse, etc...she decided to, out of the blue, ask me for $500 because her ""mom needs help and she can't afford to give it to her."" Now, even my own family members, I'm training to be a R.N., are spending my future earning potential because they ""offered"" to help pay for Nursing school. 

With everything happening, it feels like I'm just a potential meal ticket to these people. Not just my family - that's a WHOLE other rabbit hole of toxicity and pieces of shit - but my ex wife decided to ""check up on me."" by e-mailing me and poking questions about work, my life, etc....and my ex girlfriend wanting money because her ""mom needs help."" It just feels like that I'm someone's winning lottery ticket! Honestly, I fucking HATE this feeling! Like ""You scratch my back, I'll scratch yours."" kind of thing, ya know? 

The people that ACTUALLY care about me have been screaming at me to ""Jump ship!"" and bail! There's one part of me that wants to finish my program - I'm 9 months away from finishing - and get out of town. However, there's that part where they'll pop up once again. I just...I dunno. I wouldn't say ""hopeless"", but like a pawn used in someone's game. Like ""Well, I'm helping you do this, I want this in return."" When in actuality, I just want peace and to fufill my dreams. Nothing more, nothing less. And not seen as some pawn! 

I had to get this off of my chest, because there's a part of me that just wants to cry and scream at the top of my lungs. I'm so tired of being seen as an asset and being seen as a ticket out of people's shitty life decisions. That people see my kindness as weakness.

I hope this is welcome here. I'll put the sources that I'm using for this post in the comments, as it looks like posts aren't allowed to have links here, but I always cite my sources. There are many resources online about executive dysfunction but these are the ones I went with here.

In the first article I shared in the comments, the author defines executive dysfunction as ""the range of cognitive, behavioral, and emotional difficulties which often occur as a result of another disorder or a traumatic brain injury."" I focus here on ADHD and brain damage, as these are my main problems I am trying to overcome. 

These difficulties include problems with planning/organization, remembering tasks or work that's due, or procrastinating, mood disturbances, impulsive behaviors, and other bothersome symptoms. 

This first article discusses this problem in context of ADHD in adults and children. And the second webpage explains the role of frontal lobe injuries in people who experience executive dysfunction.

*Headway* (shared second) explains how this dysfunction is also related to injuries to the frontal cortex, and can affect one's social interactions. ""It is often hard for people with frontal lobe injuries to explain the difficulties they are experiencing, often because they may be unaware that their behavior is inappropriate."" This often is because people with frontal lobe injuries or anxiety disorders are not aware of their own behavior as others perceive it.

According to the souce, ""Since the executive functions are involved in even the most routine activities, frontal lobe injuries can lead to deficits in cognitive (thinking) skills, personality and social behaviour."" Many of us who have MH struggles as adults had troubled or abusive pasts, and many have been hit in the head **hard**, and suffered untreated brain injuries. I don't have statistics on that, sorry. (I'm not writing a research essay on this ... yet?) But for me, the brain damage element of this puzzle became a big ""aha"" point for me: I was hit in the head a lot by my ex boyfriend... knocked out cold. While I do have ADHD as well, the brain injuries explain the severity of my executive dysfunction. These things come back to haunt some people when they are experiencing extreme stress, because of that area of the brain that is damaged is also making emotional stress harder to process. **It becomes a vicious cycle.** 

Now I am dealing with nerve damage too, and my doctors believe it originated with the injuries to the back of my head years ago, but was triggered by another series of traumas. I'm on the right track.

**So, how to fix this problem?** Both links I share here offer suggestions for support, therapy, and treatment. For me, I'm waiting for CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy) which is designed to rewire the brain, essentially, replacing negative behaviors with positive ones. I'm hopeful. And I hope my post helps someone.

Above all, seek professional help if you're affected by this kind of anxiety, depression, paralysis of expression, etcetera. You may find answers if you ask the right questions. There's a way through this, and professionals who understand.

To make matters worse, I have been messaging another man on my Facebook page and my husband caught me last night and now I feel horrendous.

I never met the man in person and didn‚Äôt intend to physically cheat on my husband. I just liked the attention. 

My husband has been talking about my weight a lot recently, calling me a manatee and cracking jokes that I‚Äôm ‚Äúfudgy the whale‚Äù etc. he told me not to tell people at a hotel we were at this week that I was his wife because ‚Äúpeople would expect him to be with someone better looking and more classy‚Äù

this other man started telling me I was beautiful, his fantasy girl, someone he loves and cares about. I enjoyed being told these things and egged them on. I even sent him photos and videos of myself.

My husband says he isn‚Äôt going to divorce me (I‚Äôm lucky for that) but said something last night that cut me to the emotional bone- ‚ÄúI used to trust you. This is something I used to love about you. That you would never do this to me‚Äù. 

I feel horrible. I can‚Äôt stop crying. I am vomiting and can‚Äôt hold down food or water.

I know it‚Äôs my fault but I honestly feel that I don‚Äôt deserve to be his wife. I don‚Äôt even feel that I deserve to live at this point.

I want this pain to end. I know this is the consequences of my own actions but I want to off myself. 

Any advice? Is it possible to regain his trust? I gave him my Facebook, Instagram and TikTok logins as well as access to my phone for texts, photos, etc. he said he didn‚Äôt want that information but I gave it to him anyway. 

As far as feeling suicidal‚Ä¶ will this ever go away? I‚Äôm going through so much guilt, anguish and self-torment. I know I deserve that and worse, and I know I will never forgive myself.

Hello everyone!

I am reaching out on behalf of Stories Out Loud, an upcoming global mental health storytelling platform born out of the [Prismatic Social Innovation Fellowship](https://www.prismaticmovement.org/social-innovation). It was created by 4 young adults from Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the United States of America. Our goal is to create a global brave space where people can share their mental health journey stories and find info on where to seek professional mental health help in their area.

We would appreciate it greatly if you could take a few minutes of your time and tell us about your mental health journey anonymously (in audio or text format, or even through an art form), and accessible mental health resources around you. Find our survey [here](https://app.voiceform.com/to/kCjFJZJZVTB7Vcl7). It would be very helpful if you could also share this with other people as well.

Like really, really stuck..

I experienced a lot of stress and had a breakdown, then got covid, had my period and another breakdown and it's broken me...

Since November last year, I've spent most of my days in bed, I don't cook anymore, don't eat breakfast, lunch or dinner, I just eat snacks all day like crisps/chips, crackers, noodles, brownies, hot dogs and that's it really, I haven't lost any weight doing this really, I'm actually the heaviest I've ever been in my life...

I don't really shower much either or brush my teeth anymore, it feels like too much work and effort and I'd rather stay in bed where I feel comfortable and safe ... Mostly the thought of having a shower repulses me... I don't really dress in nice clothes anymore either, I just go out in tracksuit bottoms and a jumper...

I CANNOT get out of this... I cannot get into s routine of showering regularly, I cannot push myself to cook proper food, I buy food from the shop to cook, but it always ends up going rotten because I never cook it...

I just can't push myself, most days I just think ""ah, screw it, I don't care"", and other days I don't even think about showering or eating or think about the fact I haven't washed for a week, I just don't care anymore, I see no reason to shower or cook because I simply don't care...

I KNOW that when I shower, eat well, care for myself, it makes me feel better, happy, it lifts my mood and gets me out of that hole, but even knowing this, I still don't do it, I don't do this simple thing which will improve how I feel, I just accept my sadness and give into my depression...

I need to get back into a routine, I know at first it will seem hard work, not enjoyable, an effort, something I won't like, but I will eventually relax with it and enjoy it and it will be easy and make me feel better, but I just can't get myself started...

I'll spend one night pampering myself, dying my hair, putting on a face mask, showering, shaving, and I realise how much it's lifted my mood and made me happy, and tell myself I'll have another shower tomorrow, (or I'll put on a face mask the next day and have a shower the day after, and have showers every other day, because I think if I push myself to shower everyday, I'll stop doing it) but once tomorrow comes, I'm back in bed, not wanting to shower, not wanting to do anything....

I don't know what to do .. I'm feeling kind of helpless and desperate for a cure to this... I want to snap my fingers and stop feeling this way and get back into a routine... I need help to get better, I need help to know what to do... 

I'm desperate to get out of this hole and get back to being clean and eating and wanting to cook but I honestly don't know what to do or how to get out of this ....

I just cannot get out of bed... I have no reason to... I'm unemployed because of my mental disorders and disabilities and I have no purpose anymore.. like why should I get out of bed, why should I shower? It doesn't bother me not washing so what's the point in doing it?

11xm8th,MentalHealthSupport,1679416502.0,"I have been blessed with the ability to freak myself right the F\*$& out whenever i think about a host of different topics... anxiety. Now most of these topics ive been able to find categories for, and address in that way, by learning about those things, bettering my understanding of them, and really evaluating exactly what it is that im afraid of. For example, i am a hypochondriac, i  have lived with health anxiety for as long as i can remember, but its very easy to find out what health anxiety is, you can easily find other peoples experiences, common coping mechanisms, potential causes for this anxiety, etc. This is the case with almost anything i find myself consistently anxious about.

Now,

One of the darkest corners in my mind that i try to stay out of as much as possible, is one that i cant get a lot of information on, and because of this, i don't know how to move forward in addressing this.

This anxiety / fear is triggered by thoughts of existence, reality, the thought of consciousness... trying to wrap my mind around what it is that I'm experiencing just by being alive in the first place. A good example thought of this would be this: 

Whether you are reading this on a computer or phone or tablet... stop and take a second to think about what is between your eyes reading this, and the screen Infront of you, now i don't mean the air, pollen, dust, particles etc. that occupies that space, but the f#$%ing space itself. How? why is that there? what is that occupying? how did it get there?

I experience symptoms of derealization / depersonalization disorder that I've observed are closely related to my thoughts like this, Hell I believed when I was 17 until 20 I was falling into psychosis due to my relentless obsessing over the unanswerable. Its not even one specific mind-F#$\* that does this to me, it's the combination of all of them that represent what we call ""reality"" or ""existence"" that i cant tune out, and the more i try to research these things in my life, the more questions that are left unanswered. i can barely hold conversations with people because of how often i just go blank, returning to being consumed with mulling these things over, IN THE MIDDLE OF CONVERSATIONS.

I feel like most people are able to just curb these thoughts as ""unimportant"" or just set them aside because there's no way to answer things like that at the moment. Boy do i wish i could do just that. Thoughts like this are 25/8 on my mind, I mean I DREAM about inexplicable things that could never be answered, and i wake up, open my eyes and wonder what is this plane of existence that I'm experiencing? how do i retain my persona, my memories, my trains of thought, all of my experiences after so many years? How do i face any interaction, any experience, any leaf that lands Infront of me on a walk without my mind jumping to the probability of these things happening? And then wondering how I'm even able to question that in the first place?

This has not been a mid-life crisis, rather it has been a whole-life drain.
